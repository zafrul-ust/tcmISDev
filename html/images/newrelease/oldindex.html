	<BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><B>There has been a new release which contains the following enhancements:  </B></FONT></CENTER>                  
      <BR><BR>1. OOR Ordering - Revised Relax Shelf Life message (Fig. 1).  When an OOR is ordered and there is stock on hand in the hub then users are told there is on hand material and the minimum days left to expiration.  Users are asked to choose whether to receive this material or order fresh.  If the material has greater than 1 year shelf life it will not ask but pull directly from stock.

      <BR><BR>2. Catalog Right Mouse Info - The Reorder Point and Stocking Levels for MM parts as well as any Quality Requirements for each part will now be available on the right mouse menu of the Catalog Screen (See Figs 2 and 3).  Note that if there are several MM parts assigned to the on hand item for that part, the available inventory may be larger than the Stocking Level for that particular part.

      <BR><BR><IMG src="/images/newrelease/newfeaPicture3.jpg" WIDTH="720"><BR><CENTER><B>Figure 3  </B> </CENTER> 
      <BR><BR>3. Scheduled Delivery of MM Part – If you enter a scheduled delivery for a MM part, you will notice that an extra message will appear when you click on View Schedule (Fig. 4).  This is because we are going to process your scheduled request differently than before to protect your schedule.  If you normally order this MM part as non-scheduled MRs and now you begin to order as scheduled deliveries, you are now changing your ordering method and we need to adjust our stocking levels otherwise we order for both stock and your scheduled delivery.
      <BR><BR><IMG src="/images/newrelease/newfeaPicture4.jpg"><BR><CENTER><B>Figure 4  </B> </CENTER> 
      <BR><BR>4. All Ordering – Upon MR submittal, tcmIS will display an MR Allocation Report (Fig. 5) if your request does not require further approval.  This way, you will know the status of your MR immediately.  This screen can printed for your records (Fig. 6).  Finally, this screen/report can be selected from the MR screen or the Order Tracking Screen (see below) at any time in the future and will contain the latest information on your order.

      <BR><BR>5. Order Tracking -  A Right Mouse menu has been added to Order Tracking screen.  Selections from this menu will produce the usual links to the MR screen and Order Status and in addition will link to the MR Allocation Report for the entire MR discussed above and a link to your Line Schedule if the line is for a Scheduled Delivery - noted by the new type “SCH”  (Figs 7 and 8).

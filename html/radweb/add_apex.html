A direct APEX charge is called a "Network" and is a 13-character<br>
string, usually starting with (at least) 9 numbers.  It is a single<br>
field, although most Raytheon people will give it to you as<br>
600211111-2345 (for example).
<p>
An indirect APEX charge number is either a Statistical Order, which<br>
is a 7-digit number starting with 1, or an Internal Order with a<br>
Cost Center, with is usually a 7-digit number starting with 9 and<br>
a 5-digit number.  For Tucson, the two main Internal Orders are<br>
9000226 and 9000227; for New England, material is normally 9003600<br>
and waste is normally 9003601.  Often an end-user will give you the<br>
5-digit Cost Center (11052, for example) and a six-digit number that<br>
has no meaning to us, like 604005.  Ignore the six-digit number and<br>
enter the Cost Center with the default I.O. of 9000226 or 9003600.<p>

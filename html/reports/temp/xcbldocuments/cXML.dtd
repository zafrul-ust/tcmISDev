    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set.  Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage).  The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other.  The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information.  The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location.  (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.)  The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser.  This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    OriginatorCookie - Identification of a specific PunchOut session.  Used

-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>

<!--
    Header of an order.  This is the data that is sent to the supplier
    to have them place an order in their order management system. Money
    represents the total amount of this order.

    orderID
        The buyer system orderID for this request.  This is an internal
        Buyer unique number.

    orderVersion
        The buyer system order version number for this request. Relevant when
        the OrderRequest represents a change order request. The version number
        for the original document should be 1 and should be incremented by 1 for
        each subsequent version (2,3,4...).

    isInternalVersion
        A value of yes indicates that this OrderRequest is a version whose changes from
        the previous version are deemed internal to the buyer system. Relevant when the
        version being sent to the supplier is not the first version.

    orderDate
        The date and time the order request was created.

    type
        The type of the order request. Defaults to "new".

    requisitionID
        The buyers system requisition id for this entire order. It might be
        the same as orderID, and it might not be included at all.  Must not
        be included if requisitionID is specified in any ItemOut elements.

    shipComplete
        Optional preference for "hold until complete" processing.  Defaults
        to shipping when available if not specified.  Future versions of the
        protocol may extend the datatype of this attribute to include
        additional possible values (such as "unlessGreatlyBackOrdered"?).

    orderType
        "release", indicates that this is a Release Order from an existing
	Master Agreement/ Contract. Default is regular. Type "blanket" indicates
	that this order is a Blanket Order.
    releaseRequired
	"yes" if the blanket order allows released. Currently used only if 
	orderType is "blanket".
    effectiveDate
	Date the order is available for ordering. If orderType is "blanket", 
	effectiveDate is required. Otherwise it is optional. Currently only
	used with blanket orders.
    expirationDate
	Date the order is no longer available. If not defined, end date is open
	ended. Currently only used with blanket orders.
    agreementID
        Identifies associated agreement corresponding to the Release Order.
	At an implementation level it has to be validated that if the orderType
	is 'release' then the appropriate agreementID is also provided.
    agreementPayloadID
        Optional PayloadID for the corresponding Master Agreement.

    parentAgreementID
	Used only in the context of a Order of type "blanket". This identifies the
	parent blanket order if the current order is part of an hierarchy.

    parentAgreementPayloadID
        Optional PayloadID for the corresponding Master Agreement.
        
    pickUpDate
  	Specifies the date when the goods can be/will be provided for picking up and delivery

    requestedDeliveryDate
	The requested delivery date reflects the time when the buyer is willing to receive the goods.

    Total 
	If the Order is of type "blanket", the Total element is not used to compute
	the sum of the item level subtotals. The total is used to indicate the maximum
	commitment with the supplier. The total will not add upto the individual item
	level sub total or MaxAmounts. The item level MaxAmounts should not exceed the
	header level total. If the item level MaxAmount is not specified it is assumed
	that the Item level maximum amount is the same as the Total.
    
     DeliveryPeriod
     	Start and end date for the delivery.
     	
     IdReference
       ID reference is Within the application context (for example,
a certain pair of buyer and supplier), 
       the (identifier, domain) pair
 should be unique.

    The contained DocumentReference element would appear in a document only
    when the type is "update" or "delete".  In that case, the
    DocumentReference would reference the most recent OrderRequest document
    for the order.  For example when an order is created, updated and then
    deleted, the final document should contain a DocumentReference
    referring to the OrderRequest with type="update".  That document would,
    in turn, refer to the original (type="new") OrderRequest document.

    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC).  This is used in

    receiver) that it is authenticated by a shared secret with a third
    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender.  The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (i.e., it should be secure and non-reversible).  The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party.  E.g., the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender.  E.g., the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
    or sequence number.

    type
        An implementation-dependent identifier for the exact data
        being authenticated and the method in which it is formatted
        for authentication.  Currently the only supported value is
        "FromSenderCredentials".

        value is "HMAC-SHA1-96".

    AuthRequest

    An AuthRequest is used when one party (the "receiver") receives
    credentials from another party (the "principal") and the receiver
    needs a trusted third party to validate the credentials.  The
    receiver should enclose the credentials in an AuthRequest and send
    them to the trusted third party for validation.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate by revealing the shared
    secret between itself and the trusted third party (not
    recommended), the receiver should forward the credentials as they
    were received, including the shared secret.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate through a client
    certificate (recommended), the receiver should forward the
    credentials as well as an X509Data element containing an
    X509IssuerSerial element describing the certificate used by the
    principal (the receiver normally obtains this information from its
    webserver or SSL/TLS implementation).

    If the supplied credential is invalid, the trusted third party
    should respond with an empty cXML response of status 403
    (Forbidden).  If the supplied credential is valid, the trusted
    third party should respond with an AuthResponse that contains the
    valid credentials.

            bankAccountID   : Domestic account number
            ibanID          : IBAN ID (International Bank Account Number) as
                              specified in ISO 13616.

        The bank identification is specified as follows:
            abaRoutingNumber: ABA (American Banking Association)
                              Routing Number)
            swiftID         : SWIFT ID (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
                              Telecommunications)
            chipsID         : CHIPS ID (Clearing House Interbank Payment System)
            isoBicID        : ISO BIC ID (Bank Identifier Code) as specified
                              in ISO 9362.
                              The Bank Identifier Code (BIC) is a
                              universal method of identifying
                              financial institutions. The BIC consists
                              of 8 or 11 characters, comprising a bank
                              code (4 characters), a country code (2
                              characters), a location code (2
                              characters) and an optional branch code
                              (3 characters).

            bankNationalID : If none of the above bank identification
                             methods are applicable, then use this to
                             specify national clearing codes that are
                             specific to a country. This identification
                             if used, should uniquely identify
                             the bank within the country specified in the
                             Contact.
	
	    
        The bank branch identification, if necessary, is specified as follows:
            bankBranchID    : The bank branch ID

        behaves as the payee for receiving correspondent bank.  We need this new role because 
        in the wire transfer case, the receiving party could have up to two banks: beneficiary 
        and corresponding banks.  Hence,  payee role is needed to contain the information about 
        beneficiary bank account and receivingBank role is needed to contain the information 
        about the beneficiary bank.  Similary, for the receiving correspondent bank, we have the 
        roles receivingCorresondent and receivingCorrespondentBank

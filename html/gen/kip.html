<b>BIG BOARD: Kiper's Top 25 NFL prospects | Feb. 27</b>
<p>
Larry Fitzgerald now has some competition. The sophomore WR from Pittsburgh is still No. 1 overall on my Big Board of the top 25 NFL prospects, but fellow sophomore wideout Mike Williams of USC is now eligible for the draft and immediately becomes the No. 2 player on the board. A good workout showing could vault Williams ahead of Fitzgerald before all is said and done. 
<p>
With the addition of Williams there are now 14 underclassmen among the top 25 prospects, including four of the top five and seven of the top 10. Miami leads the way with five players on the list, followed by USC with three and Ohio State and Virginia Tech with two each. 
<p>
<b>1. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=134936">Larry Fitzgerald</a> (so.), WR, Pittsburgh (6-2&#190;, 225) | previous ranking: 1</b><br>
A special player with humility and a great work ethic. He has huge hands and no one has better hand-eye coordination, maybe ever, than Fitzgerald. He also has the ability to shield the defender from the ball and adjust his body in the air, but the only question is whether he has truly big-time speed. We've seen with players like Jerry Rice, though, that a 4.5 in the 40 is fast enough if you have strength, good feet and a burst out of the break on routes. Fitzgerald does need to work on beating the jam off the line in press coverage, but I don't know how you can beat his combination of discipline, attitude and physical ability.

A terrific high school basketball player, Williams was not recruited by all schools as a wide receiver but certainly has shown at USC that some people missed the boat. He was an immediate factor upon his arrival as his strength, toughness and long arms made him pretty much uncoverable. Williams and Fitzgerald be in a two-horse race to determine who is the best overall prospect. Williams is slightly bigger and Fitzgerad's equal when it comes to football skills like route running, body control and natural pass-catching ability, and they have similar attitude and work ethic. The determining factor will be speed. Whichever has a better showing during his individual workout will have the edge.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>3. Sean Taylor (jr.), S, Miami-Florida (6-2&#188;, 225) | previous ranking: 2</b><br>
Taylor is to the safety spot at Miami what Ray Lewis was to the middle linebacker position. He follows in the footsteps of former Miami safeties Bennie Blades, Darryl Williams and Ed Reed (all were first-round picks). I expect Taylor to be even better. In fact, he could be the best safety in the NFL early in his career. Taylor is the prototypical Pro Bowl safety: tremendous speed, a nose for the ball, aggressive, a great tackler and terrific in coverage (team-leading nine interceptions). He has such tremendous instincts and awareness. Worthy of being a top-five pick.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>4. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=32277">Eli Manning</a>, QB, Ole Miss (6-4, 210) | previous ranking: 3</b><br>
Manning has an outstanding arm and possesses tremendous pocket awareness. He has stepped up his intensity in the huddle as well as his leadership on and off the field. He's accurate, poised and intelligent. Manning began the season at No. 4 on my Big Board. His situation this year is comparable to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=6337">Carson Palmer</a>'s last year. Palmer rose up the draft board and wound up becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft (to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=cin">Cincinnati Bengals</a>). If Manning had declared for the draft last year, he could have been a late first-rounder. He's the younger brother of Colts QB <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=4256">Peyton Manning</a>. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>5. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=102347">Ben Roethlisberger</a> (jr.), QB, Miami-Ohio (6-5, 245) | previous ranking: 5</b><br>
Roethlisberger was a wide receiver until his senior year of high school, so he wasn't heavily recruited. But he's emerged as a potential top-five pick overall after a remarkable year. He has great size and surprising mobility for his size. In the GMAC Bowl, Roethlisberger completed 21-of-33 passes for 376 yards and four TDs (and no interceptions). After the game, he declared for the NFL draft. In the regular season, he completed 65 percent of his passes and threw 33 touchdowns (and just 10 picks).
<p>
Roethlisberger possesses all the intangibles NFL teams look for: passion for the game, intelligence, work ethic. Plus, he has great physical ability. In the first game of the 2003 season, Roethlisberger was intercepted four times in a 21-3 loss at Iowa. But he rebounded from that season-opening disaster to play at an extremely high level the rest of the campaign. He has a slightly slower delivery than some QBs, but his release point is fine and he delivers the ball accurately. Roethlisberger reminds me of <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=nyj">New York Jets</a> QB <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5047">Chad Pennington</a>. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>6. Robert Gallery, OT, Iowa (6-7, 318) | previous ranking: 5</b><br>
His size and physical skills make him ideally suited for pass protection. Over the past two years, Gallery has developed into one of the nation's premier left tackles. Intelligent and a good athlete, he started his college career as a tight end. He's gotten bigger and stronger throughout his college career. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>7. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=128009">Kellen Winslow</a> (jr.), TE, Miami-Florida (6-4&#188;, 250) | previous ranking: same</b><br>
The NFL tight end position has been redefined and expanded in recent years by guys like <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5478">Todd Heap</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5900">Jeremy Shockey</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3950">Tony Gonzalez</a>. Winslow is in that mold as well. He has the speed, athleticism and pass-receiving skill usually reserved for a wide receiver. Miami's quarterback play in 2003 was erratic, which affected Winslow's production, but he'll provide an unbelievable dimension to an NFL passing game. He can be careless in terms of ball security, so he'll need to be aware of that at the next level. Like his teammate, safety Sean Taylor, Winslow is worthy of being a top-five pick.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>8. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=108238">Roy Williams</a>, WR, Texas (6-4, 213) | previous ranking: 4</b><br>
Williams is a brilliant talent who excelled in 2003 despite a lack of consistent quarterback play. Texas ran a conservative offense that wasn't sophisticated in its passing schemes. Still, Williams averaged 16.1 yards per catch on 61 receptions with eight TDs.
<p>
A superb athlete with great size, Williams averaged 17.8 yards per catch with 12 TDs as a junior in '02, when he returned to the all-world form he displayed as a freshman after slipping some as a sophomore (when he averaged just 12.5 yards per catch). If Williams had declared for the 2003 draft, he likely would have been an overall top 10-15 pick and the third receiver off the board, behind Michigan State's <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=6338">Charles Rogers</a> and Miami's <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=6339">Andre Johnson</a>. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>9. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=105812">Philip Rivers</a>, QB, N.C. State (6-4&#189;, 230) | previous ranking: 8</b><br>
Rivers was a constant on my top-five weekly Heisman list in 2003 because of his phenomenal performance. Look at his '03 numbers: He completed 71 percent of his passes, with 4,016 yards, 29 TDs and just seven interceptions. Rivers has great size and a good arm, though his lower release point could be a question mark and his footwork is not polished. But he makes up for that low release with an incredibly quick, hair-trigger release. Rivers is accurate, smart and an excellent leader with great instincts. He stole the show at the Senior Bowl in both practice and the game, taking home MVP honors and vaulting himself into the top 10. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>10. Kenechi Udeze (jr.), DE, USC (6-3, 277) | previous ranking: 9</b><br>
Udeze has been a strong-side DE most of his career and has excellent natural pass-rushing ability. He plays strong and was a DT early in his career but, regardless of position, he was one of the best defensive players in college football over the course of his junior year. Udeze recorded 16.5 sacks among his 26 tackles for loss in 2003, and the scary thing is there is still room for improvement. He and Will Smith will be in a battle until draft day to determine which will be the first DE taken off the board. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>11. Tommie Harris (jr.), DT, Oklahoma (6-3, 280) | previous ranking: 10</b><br>
Harris has been a fixture on the defensive line for the Sooners since his freshman year. He played through injury in 2002 and was not as effective as the year before, yet he was still able to occupy blockers and free his teammates to make plays. Harris is not a guy who will dominate with brute force, but what makes him effective is his quickness off the ball and ability to shed blocks and get into the backfield. You would like to see him dominate games on a more consistent basis despite the fact that he is double and triple-teamed on every play, though. He does not pile up lots of tackles or wow you from a production standpoint, but Harris does hustle for 60 minutes and allow his teammates to do their jobs. When he does make plays, though, they are usually big ones in the offensive backfield. Harris may not be the top-five guy I once envisioned, but he's certainly worthy of being taken in the top 10 overall. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>12. Will Smith, DE, Ohio State (6-3&#189;, 255) | previous ranking: 11</b><br>
Smith is an excellent natural pass rusher with great closing speed. He was the headliner on the Buckeyes' stellar defensive front seven during last season's national championship run (recording 10&#189; tackles for loss and 4&#189; sacks). Had he declared for the 2003 draft, he probably would have been a late first-rounder. In '04 he's likely a early first-round pick. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>13. Vince Wilfork (jr.), DL, Miami (6-1, 360) | previous ranking: 15</b><br>
Wilfork has been turning heads since his arrival on campus because of tremendous athletic ability for a player his size. A former shot-putter and the school's indoor record-holder, on the football field he totalled 9&#189; tackles for loss this season -- including six sacks -- and 23 quarterback hurries. Wilfork is very quick and can collapse the pocket, and he compensates for his short arms and lack of ideal height with a strong frame and athleticism. His technique and leverage are also outstanding but the only concern is whether he can drop 15-20 pounds and keep his weight at a manageable level. If he can, Wilfork will be a heck of a player at the next level. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>14. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=122265">Steven Jackson</a> (jr.), RB, Oregon State (6-2, 231) | previous ranking: same</b><br>
Jackson is a tremendous blend of quickness and power. While he isn't as shifty or elusive as smaller backs, he runs with power and makes defenders miss with his athleticism. Jackson also has ability and versatility as a receiving option (39 receptions in 2003 to go with his 1,396 rushing yards). He does damage in the open field and has a nose for the end zone (15 rushing TDs plus two receiving TDs). Jackson gets better as the game goes along.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>15. Chris Gamble (jr.), CB, Ohio State (6-1&#189;, 185) | previous ranking: 12</b><br>
Gamble is physically gifted but not yet a finished product. He has not been a full-time corner until this season, but with his size and recovery speed Gamble has unlimited upside. His ball skills are decent and he needs to refine himself from a technique standpoint. Gamble had an excellent game in the Fiesta Bowl against Kansas State (four pass breakups and an interception) and is a guy who will be drafted more on potential than his ability to become an immediate shut down corner in the NFL. He needs a year of seasoning to become a top-flight corner but Gamble will survive his first season because of his pure athletic ability, and once he gets coached up, he can become a great pro player. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>16. Dunta Robinson, CB, South Carolina (5-11, 188) | previous ranking: 20</b><br>
An underrated SEC standout, Robinson has excellent feet and great ball skills. There aren't many wide receivers who can accelerate past Robinson on deep routes. He consistently runs the 40-yard dash in the 4.40-4.45 range. Robinson is the kind of shutdown corner who can match up against the opponent's best receiver and maintain excellent coverage the entire game.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>17. Shawn Andrews (jr.), OT, Arkansas (6-5, 360) | previous ranking: 13</b><br>
A huge right tackle, Andrews is a tremendous run-blocker, dominating the defensive end he works against and driving him significantly off the ball. He would accentuate an NFL rushing game. He's also light on his feet for a player his size, making him adequate in pass protection. Andrews has been an All-American caliber offensive tackle since his freshman year. I expect him to go in the early-to-mid first round.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>18. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=100260">Ben Troupe</a>, TE, Florida (6-4&#188;, 260) | previous ranking: same</b><br>
Troupe is an imposing figure and a gifted athlete. In 2003, he hauled in 39 receptions, averaging 16.4 yards per catch with five TDs. Last season, he caught just 15 passes while sharing time with current NFL tight end <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=6497">Aaron Walker</a>. As Troupe maximizes his ability and refines his pass-catching game, he will become a high-quality NFL tight end. Coming into the season, I envisioned him as a first- or second-round draft choice. Now, I expect him to be a solid first-rounder.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>19. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=116931">Michael Clayton</a> (jr.), WR, LSU (6-3&#189;) | previous ranking: 17</b><br>
Speed is the only issue for Clayton because he has all the other attributes you want in a wide receiver. He has excellent size, is a very polished natural receiver and plays bigger than his listed height because of his ability to go up high and come down with the ball. He has improved steadily in each of his three seasons at LSU and caught 69 balls for a 13.9-yard  average, including eight touchdowns, in 2003. Not only is Clayton a terrific pass catcher, he is also a special teams standout and played a little safety for the Tigers this season. LSU coach Nick Saban has said Clayton could have been an All-America safety had that been his full-time position, which tells you all you need to know about his toughness and athletic prowess. But Clayton's final draft projection will be dictated by his 40 times. With a little more natural speed he would be a top-10 caliber player, but with good workout numbers Clayton looks like a mid-to-late first-rounder. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>20. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=119000">Reggie Williams</a> (jr.), WR, Washington (6-3&#189;, 218) | previous ranking: 16</b><br>
Williams has the size and physical skills every NFL team is looking for. His size will give him a matchup advantage against even the biggest cornerbacks at the next level. The first player in school history to start the first game of his freshman season, Williams caught four passes for 134 yards against Michigan in that debut and set the tone for an excellent, consistent career. He's a focused competitor with a businesslike approach, and even without the benefit of a solid running game and offensive line Williams still finished tied fourth nationally with an average of 7.42 receptions per game. Demonstrating speed will be key in his workouts; if Williams can run the 40-yard dash in the 4.47-4.52 range he will be a top-10 selection.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>21. Will Poole, CB, USC (5-11, 190) | previous ranking: 19</b><br>
Originally a nickel back, Poole was not a starter until replacing the injured Kevin Arbet in the third game of 2003. He started 10 games as a redshirt freshman at Boston College in 2000, was suspended for the '01 season and transferred to Ventura Junior College in 2002 (where he intercepted seven passes). Poole is an instinctive player and an excellent tackler with good ball skills. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>22. Jonathan Vilma, LB, Miami-Florida (6-2, 230) | previous ranking: 21</b><br>
A middle linebacker who will shift to the outside in the NFL, Vilma is the latest in a long line of top-flight middle linebackers produced by the Hurricanes (including <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3542">Ray Lewis</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5119">Nate Webster</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5458">Dan Morgan</a>). He took over for Morgan, the Butkus award-winner after the 2000 season as the nation's top college linebacker. Vilma, who had outstanding 2001 and 2002 seasons, is an underrated standout on a strong team. He's smart, instinctive and fast (in the 4.5-4.6 range in the 40).
<p></p><p></p><p><b>23. Daryl Smith, LB, Georgia Tech (6-3&#188;, 235) | previous ranking: 22</b><br>
Smith was one of the best defensive players in the ACC from the time he became a starter as a true freshman and finished his collegiate career with 383 tackles, including 48 behind the line of scrimmage. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and came up big with six tackles in the first half of the game itself. Smith showed instincts and a high intensity level and is an excellent overall player. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>24. DeAngelo Hall (jr.), CB, Virginia Tech (5-10&#189;, 196)  | previous ranking: unranked</b><br>
Hall has said that he'll run the 40-yard dash in the 4.2 range, which would give him unbelievable recovery speed. While he lacks ideal height, he's strong and has a chiseled frame. His combination of strength and speed is impressive for a cover corner. As a punt returner, Hall averaged 14.5 yards per return (returning two TDs). If he were taller, he'd be a sure mid-first-rounder. I still see him as a first-round pick.
<p></p><p></p><p><b>25. Jake Grove, C, Virginia Tech (6-3, 300) | previous ranking: unranked</b><br>
It's rare to see a first-round-caliber center. It happened last year, when Notre Dame's <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=6357">Jeff Faine</a> was drafted by the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=cle">Cleveland Browns</a> in the first round. It could happen this year with Grove, an outstanding anchor who controlled the interior of the Hokies' offensive line. Grove has the ability to fire out at the middle linebacker while also handling collapse-the-pocket defensive tackles extremely well. As the QB of the O-line, he's a great leader. A rugged competitor, Grove is tough as nails and has played in lots of big games at perennial power Virginia Tech. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>DROPPED -- Dropped out of Top 25 (since last ranking):</b><br>
<b>Randy Starks, DT, Maryland (6-4, 305) | previous ranking: 23</b><br>
Starks led Maryland with 14.5 tackles for loss last season, including 7.5 sacks. He has tremendous lower body strength -- Starks holds the school record with a 765-pound squat -- and also boasts a 31&#189;-inch vertical jump. He also has a good work ethic and football savvy, but Starks does need to be a little more of a hunker-down DT against the run. His athleticism and upfield explosion should overcome that, though, and with a year of seasoning he could be a very good defensive lineman in the mold of <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=car">Carolina Panthers</a> standout <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=5491">Kris Jenkins</a>, who was drafted out of Maryland in the second round of the 2001 draft. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b>D.J. Williams, OLB, Miami-Florida (6-2, 240) | previous ranking: 24</b><br>
A superb physical specimen, Williams has developed into a tremendous player, with great athleticism and excellent range from sideline to sideline. He's also a good form tackler. He began his career as a fullback and was considered a great prospect coming out of De LaSalle High School in California. Had he declared for the 2003 draft, he probably would have been gone by the late first round. 
<p></p><p></p><p><b><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=105941">Michael Jenkins</a>, WR, Ohio State (6-4, 215) | previous ranking: 25</b><br>
A silky-smooth and very polished wideout, Jenkins had a big week at the Senior Bowl and may have moved himself into the first round of the draft. That performance came on the heels of a terrific showing against Kansas State in the Fiesta Bowl and people are taking notice. Jenkins was a co-captain for the Buckeyes in 2003 and is a very unselfish player who will do whatever it takes to win.

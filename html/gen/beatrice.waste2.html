I only got bulk gases for Tucson, although
I did get the waste stuff all prepared.
However, because Dallas used multiple 
accounting systems, I need more (different)
invoice numbers for Dallas waste.  Phooey.
It's 2 AM, so I give up on Dallas this week.

I split the invoice across the two URS accounts
when I could; I wasn't sure where "3me" started,
so I made it up (Rick doesn't care, thankfully):

AZT1 9/16 - 10/7 amount 282309.00
AZT1 8/31 - 9/13 amount 6890.00
AZT1 8/12 - 8/30 802913 amount 2160.00
AZT1 8/12 - 8/30 804705 amount 181964.14
AZT1 7/16 - 8/11 802913 amount 25644.70
AZT1 7/16 - 8/11 804705 amount 463189.36
TXLE ESN period 38 amount 186.01
TXLE JDE period 38 amount 5118.07
(these were combined as 167212)
TXLF JDE period 38 amount 1219.9
(I'll use 167213)
TXWA SAP period 38 amount 7160
(I'll use 167214)
TXMK ESN period 38 amount 4659.62
TXMK JDE period 38 amount 678.18
(these were 167215)
TXRI JDE period 38 amount 2582.72
(I'll use 167216)
TXSC ESN period 38 amount 1209.6
TXSC JDE period 38 amount 8559.99
(these were 167218)
TXSH JDE period 38 amount 6856.93
(this one was missing anyway)

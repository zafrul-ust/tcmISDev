You may have noticed that at times in print and on television and radio, I have referred to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=4924">Jeff Garcia</a> as the "toughest guy in football."
<p>
I did so because I have seen many declarations that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3114">Steve McNair</a> is that guy, or <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=1025">Brett Favre</a>, or <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3542">Ray Lewis</a>. True enough, they are tough guys. So is <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=4256">Peyton Manning</a>, who has his own consecutive playing streak, which includes a stint with a broken jaw. And to play football in the NFL at a high level, your toughness should never be questioned.
<p>
But have you ever seen Garcia in person? I mean, he's in terrific physical condition for a 34-year-old man but, for comparison sake, McNair is 6-foot-2, 240 pounds and Garcia is about 6-foot, 187 pounds.
<p>
Garcia plays with abandon &#150; sometimes reckless abandon. I've always admired him, but he completely won me over in a game last season with the 49ers. He was playing with a bad ankle and, more critically, a degenerative (sometimes bulging) disc in his back. And he played this particular game like the Super Bowl, without regard to the long-term effects of the horrific collisions he endured (and caused) while trying to put a W in the win-loss column. On one of those collisions &#150; a desperate, successful launch into the end-zone &#150; he actually made me think he was crazy. He was playing against the <i><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=ari">Arizona Cardinals</a></i>!
<p>
"I know the game you're talking about," Garcia said Monday. "It's just the way I play the game."
<p>
The point being, Garcia is out to prove himself on every play in every game.

<!---------------------INLINE HEADSHOT (END)--------------------->
If he doesn't blow himself up this season for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=cle">Cleveland Browns</a>, he may prove to be one of the most significant offseason additions in the NFL.
<p>
Even while <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3664">Terrell Owens</a> made a big splash in his debut with the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=phi">Philadelphia Eagles</a> on Sunday, it was Owens' whipping boy, Garcia, who had a more significant debut. Garcia led the Browns to a hard-fought, 20-3 victory over the Ravens in a game that he knew had to be delivered for the passionate-yet-skeptical Cleveland fans who have endured a heartbreaking franchise move &#150; not to mention the disappointment of the expansion team's first pick, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=4649">Tim Couch</a>, whose toughness eventually came into question.
<p>
"Oh, I'm very aware of (what was on the line Sunday)," said Garcia. "Cleveland is a great football town. But there's been a lot of hurt here and even though I know they go into everything season hoping for the best, a loss (to the Ravens) would have had that feeling of the-wheels-are-falling-off again and I didn't &#150; and don't &#150; want them to experience that."
<p>
Garcia carried that burden against a Baltimore defense that ravaged him a year ago when the Ravens whipped the 49ers, 44-6. Sunday's win was no picnic, but the Browns reflected the toughness that embodies their new quarterback.
<p>
"I knew it was going to be a tough, tough game and it wouldn't be pretty," said Garcia. "I knew (the Browns) had struggled against the Ravens and I knew my one brief experience last year was painful. So I had some nerves &#133; a very tough opponent, a new team, new hometown fans. I wanted to rise to the occasion but I knew I had to be patient, methodical and fight my way through some things. Fortunately, our defense and special teams allowed me to do that."

<p>
Make no mistake, without mentioning Couch or offering any specific criticism of the former Cleveland quarterback, both Garcia and Browns coach Butch Davis know that toughness at the position may have been the most screaming need of the franchise.
<p>
"It's about personal responsibility and I don't know if I have never seen anyone take it to this level," said Davis. "Jeff's attitude from the time he arrived has been unbelievably infectious &#150; from the first day he walked into the huddle, the way he practices, the ways he prepares. He's so hard on himself, the other guys can't help but be affected. He can go out there during a 7-on-7 drill and go 10-for-10 (passing), and he's ticked off that three of his passes weren't exactly where they were supposed to be. Most guys are thrilled to death &#133; that attitude opened a lot of eyes with his teammates and coaches. It's that way every day."
<p>
Garcia added, "This is a pretty young team and I think I had to bring some veteran leadership and a sense of toughness here. When I was making a decision (as a free agent), I saw a team that had talent, but young talent that needed to mature and needed to be brought together on the offensive and defensive side of the football."
<p>
Garcia's transition to a new team was going to be challenging enough, but he has been thrown a ridiculous obstacle by the irresponsible, unfounded and relentless attacks on his personal life and playing ability by Owens. For a guy who has overcome so many odds &#150; being undrafted, playing in Canada, and then becoming a three-time Pro Bowl quarterback in the wake of the Joe Montana and Steve Young era &#150; it has been a hurtful campaign.
<p>
"That's the problem I have with it &#150; there have been too many barriers I've had to overcome," said Garcia. "I've had to scratch and claw my way to get here and when someone knocks the type of person I am and creates a false impression of who I am or what I'm about &#133; well, I don't have any time for that. I don't deserve it."
<p>
In the meantime, Cleveland could have a new rock-and-roller to admire, as long as Browns fans understand that Garcia is all blue-collar.
<p>
"It's not always pretty and fancy and I'm not the biggest guy in stature," he said. "I think I bring that physical and mental toughness that they'll appreciate because I think Cleveland fans are those kinds of people. It's a workmanlike approach. That's what they're going to get with me."
<p>
It's called getting your money's worth.

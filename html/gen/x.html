Has Mark Shapiro learned something on the job about major-league talent? I admire his ability to figure out which prospects he can get from other orgs, but before this off-season, his track record on signing "established veterans" has been, shall we say, spotty? Shall we say, shitty? Matt Lawton's extension, Ricky Gutierrez, Jason Bere, Tim Laker ... I mean, the only veteran I'd give a plugged nickel for was Brian Anderson, and that wasn't much of a risk, since that's about what he signed for. There was talk about how we might pick up a player or two at mid-season if we were in contention, but until recently, the thought of Mark Shapiro doing the Drunken Sailor thing was pretty nerveracking.

Mark ShapIro going Dr. Frankenstein on our minor league talent to acquire the pieces to the major league puzzle is THE thing that worries me most about The Plan (TM).

But this off-season brings us, not counting the NRIs, Jose Jimenez, Scott Stewart, and Ron Belliard. I happen to think Belliard is a Chumpus Maximus, but at least they threw a legit offer at Todd Walker, who was confused. Jimenez is a nice extreme groundball pitcher, and Stewart will benefit from not pitching in the fifty-first state ... has Shapiro found someone else to listen to that might have a clue? Could he actually be trusted to find someone at the break who was worth a damn?

At this point I have not been given a reason to trust that he will be able to do it...and in the end, if the Indians do not turn it completely around my guess is that the inability to evaluate at the major league level will be the reason. As you say, the track record is shitty...and I would add that the signing of Ronnie Belliard, and the LA Cops like Rush To Judgment to do something, anything, to fill the 2nd base position just screams of panic...IOW, if I ever get asked to be on celebrity poker, I pray to the gods above Mark ShapIro is at my table.

If Ronnie Belliard takes one plate appearance from John McDonald, he's worth signing.
<p>
Okay, that's overstating it: a million dollars an inning is a bad investment, but seriously, if not Belliard (or Todd Walker), then whom? Here's Jhonny? Roll the dice on Bran Phillips? Adam Piatt? Be reasonable: what were our options? I would have liked to see us cull someone's overlooked yoot (on the order of Bobby Hill or the like), but Belliard doesn't seem as desperate to me as you make it sound. That doesn't invalidate your point, mind you...

If not Belliard, then whom? 
<p>
How bout anyone? 
<p>
Seriously, the reason for my beef with ShapIro over the signing of Bellieard was that it was Belliard, but "when" it was Belliard. He signed him when options 1, 2 and 3 were still on the market...by giving a take it or leave it with a deadline to Todd Walker he forced his hand and backed himself into a corner when he didn't have to. Hey, Walker may never have come here, but he ended up signing for peanuts and didn't do it until weeks after we got Belliard...what the hell was the rush to get someone, anyone?

I can't argue with the timing. That may be the more disturbing trend than anything having to do with talent evaluation, the tendency to rush. It can be argued that Robbie Alomar was dealt in too rushed a fashion, that Lawton was signed to an extension before he had to be, Gutierrez was hurried ... you may be onto something there.

The one move that intrigues me...and gives me a glimmer of hope...is Ryan Church and My-Sir Isturiz for Scott Stewert. It may flop, but at the time of the trade I like it...which is something I can't say about alot of these type moves.

I agree about Stewart, but then, I liked signing Bob Howry, too, and word is he's all but down for the count. How does this affect what you liked about the bullpen last time?

Not sure Howry is down for the count, I thought I heard he had soreness...on second thought, in TCE speak that means he will have to have his arm amputated. Doesn't change my view that much on the bully. I like Howry and think he will be a nice addition, but don't think he is a deal breaker either way.
<p>
Another question, related to this, that will have to be addressed is when is the right time to make a move to acquire major league talent? What is the winning percentage, or games back that we need to be? At what point do those numbers intersect with a date on the calender to say...now...we are in it, or not in it...in 04?

How should the decision on talent acquisition be made? Well, I certainly would give the pitching staff at least three months to figure out what the fuck I've got. As excited as every gets about young pitching, we literally have no idea which guys will do what with few exceptions. I know what we're going to get out of Sabathia and Riske, and arguably Stewart. Everyone else either has injury questions (Wickman, Howry, not to mention the lefties Talletraber) or adjustments to make (Jimenez) or we simply have no flaming clue where the intersection of Desire and Reality is (Lee, Davis, Tadano, etc.).
<p>
But as for actually answering your question, let me remove the tap shoes here ... oomph ... urk ... all right. If we're within 5 games of first place and at least 5 games over .500 on July 1, we should scope out talent. If we're within 5 games of first but between 0 and 5 games over .500 on July 1, we should wait until July 20 and check again. If we're within 5 games but actually UNDER .500, we should play the hand we're dealt and see if the guys we've got are actually any good. That work?

At first blush, I like your thinking on the rebuilding timeline for trades.
<p>
BA's AL Central Top 10 Prospects comes out this week. Grady Sizemore is on the cover...any thoughts on the Indians 1-10...and more importantly...what day do you have in the office pool for Grady's MLB debut?

As for Grady, I like May 15. One (or more) of our outfielders is sure to get hurt by then.

For the longest time my biggest concern with The Plan was how it would ultimately be implemented at the major league level...that is, what minor league guys would be traded to plug holes at the major league level...seperately from that, I had concern, smaller but still there, over how contracts would be handled in terms of both $$ and terms/years.
<p>
However, the more I think about it the more I am beginning to at least explore the possiblity that those are are really just symptoms and not the real problem...that the problem is somehow related in some way to a rush to judgment...that the errors are errors of...of...of....pre-mature something or other brought on by some sort of desire/feeling/need to do something.
<p>
I don't know...and clearly this hasn't been thought through all the way...and it would seem to run counter to someone who has the patience to implement a long term plan like the Indians have...but dammit, I am searching for answers as to why we excel in one area and not so much in the other...and I still don't really understand why.

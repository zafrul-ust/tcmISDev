<p>The <a id="CatalogPage"><strong>Catalog</strong> page</a> provides access to information on items (materials, chemicals) 
   approved for use in each facility and work area. It is used to create and submit requests (<strong>Material 
   Requests</strong>) for purchase and delivery of those items.</p>
<p>The <strong>Catalog</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu by selecting
	<strong>Catalog</strong>. It will be shown in its own tab.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Catalog1.png" height="242" width="835" alt="Catalog page menu item" />
<div class="caption">Figure 1</div></div>

<p>The first step in ordering an item is to locate it in the <strong>Part Catalog</strong>. (The <strong>Item Catalog</strong> 
   is used for items or parts not yet approved, and for ordering them for evaluation. See 
   <a href="../EngineeringEval/EngineeringEval.htm">Engineering Evaluation</a>.)</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Select the facility where the material will be used from the <strong>Facility</strong> list.</li>
	<li>Select the work area where the material will be used from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list.</li>
	<li>Select the Part catalog (Item catalog for evaluations) from the <strong>Search Type</strong> list.</li>
   <li>Enter details about the desired	material in the <strong>Search</strong> box. Search criteria can include DoE 
       part number, HGI item ID, packaging, trade name, manufacturer, manufacturer's part number, or material description.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The more specific the information entered, the more the search is narrowed. Multiple words as a logical
   expression can also be used to refine a search (separate words by <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>,
	<strong>but not</strong>; for example, prc AND 1750). To search for <em>all</em> chemicals for
	a specific location, leave the <strong>Search</strong> box blank.</p>

<p>To order any item, add it to the shopping cart by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>locating the item in the part catalog;</li>
		<li>clicking anywhere on the line to select the item (it will then be highlighted with a different background color); and,</li>
		<li>click the <strong>Add To Cart</strong> link above the data grid.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If a <a href="#comments">material with a comment attached</a> to it is selected and the <strong>Add to Cart</strong> 
	link is clicked the comment will be displayed to notify you.</p>
	<ul>
    	<li>If the comment warrants attention, click <strong>Cancel</strong> to stop adding the material to the shopping 
    		 cart and resolve any issues raised by the comment.</li>
    	<li>If the comment does not require you to do anything differently, click the <strong>Continue</strong> to add 
    		 the part to the shopping cart.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Locating and adding items to the shopping cart can be repeated until all needed items are in the shopping cart.</p>
<p><strong><em>Once the first item has been added to the shopping cart, all further additions to that cart must be for delivery to the 
	same facility but may be for different work areas.</em></strong></p>
<div class="image"><img src="Catalog4.png" height="534" width="797" alt="Material selected for shopping cart" />
<div class="caption">Figure 4</div></div>

<p>The item is added to the shopping cart and displayed in the data grid at the upper right of the page. There are 
	several actions which you can take here to adjust the item on order.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quantity on order can be replacing the number in the <strong>Quantity</strong> text box with the quantity 
    	  needed. The quantity can also be changed later on the <strong><a href="#MRquantity">Material Request</a></strong> page.</li>
    <li>The date the material is needed should be provided by clicking in the <strong>Date Needed</strong> text 
    	 box and selecting a date from the calendar. <em>If you do not provide the date here you will have to provide 
    	 it on the <strong><a href="#MRdate">Material Request</a></strong> page before you check out.</em></li>
    <li>If the need for the item is critical, check the <strong>Critical</strong> box at the right end of the row 
    	 to designate this material request as a critical order. (It will then be highlighted with a different background color.)</li>
    <li>Enter notes by clicking in the <strong>Notes</strong> column, causing a text box to open, and adding your 
    	 notes. Click outside of the text box to save the notes.</li>

<h3><a id="OptionalInformation">Material Request page optional information</a></h3>

<p>There is an opportunity on the <strong>Material Request</strong> page to provide additional delivery and user
   information to indicate the point-of-use for the order. When provided, this information applies to all line items
	on the request and will appear on the delivery ticket shipped with the material. These fields are flexible and
	remarks can be tailored to assist the end user once the item is delivered.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may enter the end user's name in the <strong>End User Name</strong> text box.</li>
	<li>You may enter the end user's department in the <strong>Department</strong> text box.</li>
	<li>You may enter contact information in the <strong>Contact Info</strong> text box.</li>

	    this an order is one in which a late delivery will shut down production or the item's lead-time is long enough to
		 create a problem with operations.</li>
	<li>Notes on any item can be added for other information that needs to be communicated to the HGI Purchasing Team. Click
	    anywhere in the <strong>Notes</strong> column for an item and a small text box is provided where you may

<h3><a id="RequiredInformation">Material Request page required information</a></h3>
<p>Charge numbers (lower left) and delivery information (lower right) <strong><em>must</em></strong> be provided for each line (item) in the <strong>Material 
   Request</strong>. Select each line (item) on the order in turn and complete the required information. As each <strong>Line</strong> 
   is selected, its line number is placed into the heading on the	<strong>Line Item Detail</strong> section. (But, see the <a href="#copyshortcut">Shortcut</a>, below.)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Under <strong>Line Item Detail</strong> select the <strong>Scrap/Obsolete</strong> check box if this order should
	     be filled from material in inventory that has been declared scrap or obsolete.</li>
    <li>Under <strong>Delivery Instructions</strong> any <strong>need by</strong> date was carried over from the 
        shopping cart, but it may also be updated on this page.</li>
    <li>There are two types of <strong><a id="MRdate">need by</a></strong> (&rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo;) dates. Your selection will 
        inform HGI exactly when to deliver the material.
    	<ul>
        	<li><strong>Deliver By</strong> deliveries are those that are needed <em>on or before</em> a specified date. Enter the date in the 
            	text box to the right of the &rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo; box using the calendar window that will open when you click into the box.</li>
        	<li><strong>Schedule</strong> deliveries are those that are needed <em>exactly on</em> a specified date or set of dates. Click 
            	the <strong>Schedule</strong> button that will appear the right of the &rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo; box (see below).</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
	 <li>Select the dock from the <strong>Dock</strong> list.</li>
    <li>Select the work area from the <strong>Deliver To</strong> list.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="copyshortcut">Shortcut</a></h4>
<p>As stated, each line (item) must be assigned charge numbers and delivery information. But there is a <strong>Copy</strong> button provided to 
	speed the process. Once you have entered the required information for any one item, you may then click on the <strong>Copy</strong> button and 
	the identical information will be added to all remaining items in every <em>BLANK</em> field. Items which already have charge numbers and/or 
	delivery information will not be affected. Once you press the <strong>Copy</strong> button an <strong>Undo</strong> button will be provided 
	in case you want to remove all copied information. After any Copy you may still manually update any field for any item.</p>

<h3><a id="ScheduledDeliveries">Scheduled Deliveries</a></h3>
<p>If a delivery needs to be scheduled for a <i>specific</i> date, whether it is a single delivery or multiple deliveries,
   select <strong>Schedule</strong> from the <strong>Delivery Instructions</strong> box. tcmIS will change the 
   date text box to a <strong>Schedule</strong> button. Click the <strong>Schedule</strong> button to open a child 
   window to display the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> page.</p>

<h2><a id="Submitanorder">Submit an order</a></h2>
<p>The final step in placing an gas order is to submit the order. Before
   submitting the order, you should review the order for accuracy and completeness.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> link to save the material request at draft status if you do not have all of the
	    required information. Draft orders can be retrieved and completed through the
		 <strong><a href="../OrderTracking/OrderTracking.htm">Order Tracking</a></strong> page.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> link to delete the entire material request <em>if the MR has not been submitted.</em></li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Delete Line</strong> link to remove a selected line from a material request.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Return to Cart</strong> link to return to the <strong>Catalog</strong> page if more parts need to
	    be added to the order.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Print This Page</strong> link to print a copy of the material request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click the <strong>Submit</strong> link to complete the process of placing the order.</p>
<p><em>If the order is for a part that is an <strong>OOR</strong> whose item is currently in stock</em>, tcmIS will prompt 
	   the requestor to allow the OOR shelf life requirement to be waived to allow the stocked item to be shipped immediately. 
	   You are informed of the minimum remaining shelf life for the delivered items from stock. Often this material is 
	   currently owned by your company and may be a lost value if no one accepts the material. If this transaction is 
	   authorized, tcmIS will attempt to fill the request immediately. There are some occasions where shipping an OOR from 
	   stock could threaten the ability to ship the stocked item to the Min/Max requirement. In these cases, the order will 
	   revert to normal OOR processing.</p>
<p>When a Material Request is submitted, tcmIS will open a child window and generate an 
	<a href="../MRAllocation/MRAllocation.htm"><strong>MR Allocation Report</strong></a>. 
	This is a detailed listing of all the items on the submitted MR. </p>
<div class="image"><img src="Catalog11.png" height="182" width="834" alt="Material Request page action links" />
<div class="caption">Figure 11</div></div>

<p>Some organizations use the financial approval, use approval, and/or releaser functions of tcmIS. If any of these
   features are used for the selected facility and work area, the material request may be sent to the designated approver
	or releaser prior to being released to HGI. Use the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page to locate an order to
	view the status.</p>
<p>When financial approval is needed for an order the approver's contact information is available from the <strong>Material
   Request</strong> page. Click the <strong>Ext Price</strong> link to see it. The <strong>Finance Approver Information</strong>
	form will be shown as a window on top of the <strong>Material Request</strong> page.</p>

<h3><a id="EditCharge">Part (or Work Area) Directed Charge</a></h3>
<p>Selecting the <strong>Edit Part Directed Charge</strong> context menu item will open a window
   to display the Charge Information form. This is used to edit the existing directed charge information for
   a part (or even a <a href="../WorkAreas/WorkAreaDefinition.htm#EditCharge">work area</a>). It comes in two forms, as illustrated, to 
   handle both Direct and Indirect charges. Make the needed changes directly on the form.</p> 
   <ul>
   	<li>Click the <strong>Remove Charge Numbers</strong> link to delete the existing charge numbers (if 
   		 any) from the part record for this work area; or,</li>
   	<li>Enter the percentage values that are appropriate in the right text column. <em>This capability</em> is 
   		 only available to those who have the appropriate responsibility and authority.</li>
   	<li><em>If available</em>, use the <strong>PO</strong> box, which may appear as a text box in which to type, or may appear as
   		 a drop-down list from which to select, to change the PO for the part record for this work area.</li>
   </ul>
<p>When done, click on the <strong>Submit</strong> link in the upper-left corner to save the changes: the new information will be used until 
   any future change is made. If you need simply to delete the existing directed charge, click the <strong>Remove 
   Charge Numbers</strong> link in the upper-left. The window will close when you click either link.</p>
<p>If directed charges have been entered for both a part and the work area, the part directed charge will be used
   rather than the work area directed charge.</p>

<p>The <strong>Material Request</strong> (MR) page allows you to view, process, and manage an order. It is launched in its own tab. The 
	<strong>Material Request</strong> page is always specific to one single Material Request and supports different actions based on the 
	status of the MR.</p>
<p>The <strong>Material Request</strong> page is used in the &rsquo;Shopping Cart&rsquo; process and in Order Tracking activity. </p>
<ul>
	<li>From the <strong>Catalog</strong> page, to create, view, or work on a Material Request, place items into the <strong>Shopping Cart</strong>. 
		 When all the needed items are in the order, click on the <strong>Check Out</strong> link.</li>

<h2>MR page actions</h2>
<p>A variety of actions are possible on the <strong>Material Request</strong> page depending on the status of the MR as well as the user&rsquo;s 
	authority or responsibility. These include:</p>
	<ul>

<h3><a id="OptionalInformation">Material Request page optional information</a></h3>
<p>There is an opportunity on the <strong>Material Request</strong> page to provide additional delivery and user
   information to indicate the point-of-use for the order. When provided, this information applies to all line items
	on the request and will appear on the delivery ticket shipped with the material. These fields are flexible and
	remarks can be tailored to assist the end user once the item is delivered.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may enter the end user's name in the <strong>End User Name</strong> text box.</li>
	<li>You may enter the end user's department in the <strong>Department</strong> text box.</li>
	<li>You may enter contact information in the <strong>Contact Info</strong> text box.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
   <li>The <a id="MRquantity">quantity ordered</a> may be changed by updating the number in the <strong>Qty</strong> column.</li>
	<li>Checking the <strong>Critical</strong> box notifies the HGI Purchasing Team that this is a Priority 1 buy, indicating
	    this an order is one in which a late delivery will shut down production or the item's lead-time is long enough to
		 create a problem with operations.</li>
	<li>Notes on any item can be added for other information that needs to be communicated to the HGI Purchasing Team. Click
	    anywhere in the <strong>Notes</strong> column for an item and a small text box is provided where you may
		 this information. Click outside the small text box and anything you have added will be saved.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="RequiredInformation">Material Request page required information</a></h3>
<p>Charge numbers (lower left) and delivery information (lower right) <strong><em>must</em></strong> be provided for each line (item) in the <strong>Material 
   Request</strong>. Select each line (item) on the order in turn and complete the required information. As each <strong>Line</strong> 
   is selected, its line number is placed into the heading on the	<strong>Line Item Detail</strong> section. (But, see the 
   <a href="#copyshortcut">Shortcut</a>, below.)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Under <strong>Line Item Detail</strong> select the <strong>Scrap/Obsolete</strong> check box if this order should
	     be filled from material in inventory that has been declared scrap or obsolete.</li>
    <li>Under <strong>Delivery Instructions</strong> any <strong>need by</strong> date was carried over from the 
        shopping cart, but it may also be updated on this page.</li>
    <li>There are two types of <strong><a id="MRdate">need by</a></strong> (&rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo;) dates. Your selection will 
        inform HGI exactly when to deliver the material.
    	<ul>
        	<li><strong>Deliver By</strong> deliveries are those that are needed <em>on or before</em> a specified date. Enter the date in the 
            	text box to the right of the &rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo; box using the calendar window that will open when you click into the box.</li>
        	<li><strong>Schedule</strong> deliveries are those that are needed <em>exactly on</em> a specified date or set of dates. Click 
            	the <strong>Schedule</strong> button that will appear the right of the &rsquo;Delivery by&rsquo; box (see below).</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
	 <li>Select the dock from the <strong>Dock</strong> list.</li>
    <li>Select the work area from the <strong>Deliver To</strong> list.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="copyshortcut">Shortcut</a></h4>
<p>As stated, each line (item) must be assigned charge numbers and delivery information. But there is a <strong>Copy</strong> button provided to 
	speed the process. Once you have entered the required information for any one item, you may then click on the <strong>Copy</strong> button and 
	the identical information will be added to all remaining items in every <em>BLANK</em> field. Items which already have charge numbers and/or 
	delivery information will not be affected. Once you press the <strong>Copy</strong> button an <strong>Undo</strong> button will be provided 
	in case you want to remove all copied information. After any Copy you may still manually update any field for any item.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 6</div></div>

<h3><a id="ScheduledDeliveries">Scheduled Deliveries</a></h3>
<p>If a delivery is to be scheduled for a <i>specific</i> date, whether it is a single delivery or multiple deliveries,
   select <strong>Schedule</strong> from the <strong>Delivery Instructions</strong> box. tcmIS will change the 
   date text box to a <strong>Schedule</strong> button. Click the <strong>Schedule</strong> button to open a child 
   window to display the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> page.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> page repeated deliveries can be scheduled for specified dates or 
	on a regularly scheduled (recurrent) basis. See the <a href="../Catalog/DeliverySchedule.htm">Delivery Schedule page</a></p>
<div class="image"><img src="MaterialRequest7.png" height="485" width="725" alt="Schedule button" />
<div class="caption">Figure 7</div></div>

<h2><a id="Submitanorder">Submit an order</a></h2>
<p>The final step in placing an order is to submit the order. Before submitting the order, you should review the 
	order for accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Submit</strong> link to complete the process of placing the order.</p>
<p><em>If the order is for a part that is an <strong>OOR</strong> whose item is currently in stock</em>, tcmIS will prompt 
	   the requestor to allow the OOR shelf life requirement to be waived to allow the stocked item to be shipped immediately. 
	   You are informed of the minimum remaining shelf life for the delivered items from stock. Often this material is 
	   currently owned by your company and may be a lost value if no one accepts the material. If this transaction is 
	   authorized, tcmIS will attempt to fill the request immediately. There are some occasions where shipping an OOR from 
	   stock could threaten the ability to ship the stocked item to the Min/Max requirement. In these cases, the order will 
	   revert to normal OOR processing.</p>
<p>When a Material Request is submitted, tcmIS will open a child window and generate an 
	<a href="../MRAllocation/MRAllocation.htm"><strong>MR Allocation Report</strong></a>. 
	This is a detailed listing of all the items on the submitted MR. </p>
<div class="image"><img src="../MRAllocation/MRAllocation4.png" width="875" height="383" alt="Sample MR Allocation Report" />
<div class="caption">Figure 8</div></div>

<p>Some organizations use the financial approval, use approval, and/or releaser functions of tcmIS. If any of these
   features are used for the selected facility and work area, the material request may be sent to the designated approver
	or releaser prior to being released to HGI. Use the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page to locate an order to
	view the status.</p>
<p>When financial approval is needed for an order the approver's contact information is available from the <strong>Material
   Request</strong> page. Click the <strong>Ext Price</strong> link to see it. The <strong>Finance Approver Information</strong>
	form will be shown as a window on top of the <strong>Material Request</strong> page.</p>

<h2><a id="cancelMR">Cancel an Order</a> (Cancel a Material Request, Cancel an MR)</h2>
<p>Sometimes an order can be cancelled; sometimes it cannot. It depends on the type of order and the status of the order, therefore 
	the initial cancellation is treated as a request until tcmIS, or HGI personnel, determine that all the criteria are met for cancellation.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong><em>requestor</em></strong> of an order can request a cancellation of the order. Locate the order (MR) on the 
			 <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page and click the <strong>View/Approve MR</strong> context menu item. See the
			 <a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm">Catalog</a> page for details.</li>
		<li>If the requestor is out of the office, or no longer with the company, the facility Administrator can request the order be cancelled.</li>
		<li>Anyone in the company, with appropriate authority, can request that the HGI CSR cancel an order.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The type and status that determine whether an order can actually be cancelled are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the MR Type is <em>MM</em> and allocated to stock, HGI will cancel the order. <em>A Restocking Fee may be 
			 associated with the cancellation of an MR.</em></li>
		<li>If the MR Type is <em>OOR</em> and the PO status is Open, the HGI buyer will contact the seller to request the order be cancelled.
			<ul>
				<li>If the seller agrees, HGI will cancel the order.</li>
				<li>If the seller declines, the customer must take the material.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If the MR Type is <em>OOR</em> and the PO has not been sent to the seller, HGI will cancel the order.</li>
		<li>If the MR Type is <em>SCH</em> the HGI buyer will get in touch with the seller to negotiate the end of the 
			 scheduled deliveries as close to the desired time as possible. The buyer will notify the requestor of the final delivery date.</li>
	</ul>

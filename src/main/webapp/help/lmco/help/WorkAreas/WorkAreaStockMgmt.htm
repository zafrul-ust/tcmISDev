<p>The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is used in tcmIS to view and manage parts in work areas: 
	activate and inactivate parts; set stocking levels; and add parts to work areas. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page can be
	accessed from the <strong>Supply Chain</strong> menu: choose <strong>Work Area Inventory</strong> and select the
	<strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> menu item. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is launched
	in a new tab.</p>

<p>Select the facility where the work areas are located from the <strong>Facility</strong> list.</p>
<p>The way in which you specify the particular work area(s) for the search affects the actions you can take on the records.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may choose to narrow the range of work areas by selecting a specific work area group from the 
		 <strong>Work Area Group</strong> list.
		 <ul>
		  	<li>If you leave the <strong>Work Area Group</strong> at the default value of <em>All</em>, the 
		  		 <strong>Work Area</strong> list will include all the work areas for the facility.</li>
		  	<li>If you choose one or more specific Work Area Groups, only work areas from that group or 
		  		 groups will be shown in the <strong>Work Area</strong> list.</li>
		  </ul>
		 </li>
	<li>You may specify specific work area(s) from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list.
		<ul>
		  	<li>If you leave the <strong>Work Area</strong> list set at the default value of <em>All</em>, there 
		  		 are some actions you <strong>cannot</strong> take:

					<li>Update any of the records;</li>
					<li>Add Nonmanaged Materials to any work area;</li>
					<li>Add [a] Part to any work area; or,</li>

			<li>You may select a single work area, or select multiple work areas by holding down the CTRL key 
				 while clicking each	wanted work area in the <strong>Work Area</strong> box.

<p>There are four links at the top left of the data grid panel:</p>
	<ul>

			 any change or wait and click it after multiple changes have been made.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Add Nonmanaged Mat</strong>[eria]<strong>l</strong> link to begin the process to add this kind of part. See 
			 <a href="NonmanagedMaterials.htm">Add Non-managed Materials</a> for details.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Add Part</strong> link to begin the process to add a Haas managed part. See <a href="#addpart">Add Part</a> for details.</li>
	</ul>
<p>There are several things that can be edited directly on the <strong>Work Area Stock Management</strong> page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a id="counttype"><strong>Count Type</strong></a> column identifies the method used for inventory replenishment for the 
		 item. Choose the	appropriate type from the drop-down list. 
		 <ul>
		 	<li><strong>Item ID</strong> indicates that the scan process only the quantity of each item
			    is entered; the individual containers are not scanned. Checking for and removal of expired material is
		 		 done by eye.</li>
		 	<li><strong>Receipt ID</strong> indicates that during the scan process each individual container will be 
		 		 scanned. This enables the scanner to record the expiration date and, in the case of expired material, 
		 		 beep loudly to notify the operator to remove the expired material.</li>
		 	<li><strong>KanBan</strong> a variant on MinMax where the reorder point is 1 bin (or fewer) and the maximum is 2 bins. Each bin 
		 		contains a part-specific quantity which can vary from 1 to any number.</li>

		 </ul>	 
	</li>
	<li>When the box in the <strong>Active</strong> column is selected, the part is available within tcmIS. Clear the box 
		 to deactivate an item. Select the box to activate an inactive item.</li>
	<li><strong>Default Part Type</strong> can be added or edited by selecting the desired type from the drop-down list for the 
		 record.</li>

			<li><strong><em>Default Application Method</em></strong></li>
			<li><strong><em>Default Substrate</em></strong></li>
 		</ul>
	</li>

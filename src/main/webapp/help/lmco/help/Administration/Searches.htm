<p>Frequently in tcmIS when looking for information you want to narrow your search to locate more specifically (and quickly) 
	the information you want.	This is often done using a specialized search mechanism.</p>
<p>There are several sorts of searches in tcmIS; they usually fall into one of four types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#lookup">Lookup forms</a> - specialized forms for looking up data, usually when you are trying to fill out another 
			 form. These are almost always invoked by clicking on a small magnifying glass icon 
			 <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" width="21" height="16" alt="magnifying glass" />.</li>
		<li><a href="#typeahead">Type ahead searches</a> have replaced some lookup forms. As text is entered into a text input box, tcmIS 
			 presents a drop-down list that displays any valid values that match that text.</li>
		<li><a href="#search">Single box text searches</a> - a single text entry box, usually preceded by the word &rsquo;Search&rsquo;, 
			 used to match specific text (letters and/or numbers).</li>
		<li><a href="#searchby">Three-box text searchs</a> - usually labeled as &rsquo;Search By&rsquo;, this search allows you to indicate 
			 the field you want searched, the text for the search, and the physical location of the text in 
			 the field.</li>
	</ul>
<h3><a id="searchby"><strong>Search [By]</a></strong></h3>
<p>A Search or Search By frequently uses three input boxes (<a href="#search">sometimes only one</a>):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the first box select the basis for the search: usually you will select the type of information (data field) such as 
			 <strong>MR-Line</strong>, <strong>Part Number</strong>, <strong>Part Desc</strong>[ription], or <strong>Item</strong>, but
			 the possibilities will vary depending on the page or report. Choose the field you want from the drop-down list.</li>
		<li>In the second box choose the type of search. Sometimes there are only two (contains and is) rather than four.
			 <ul>
				<li><strong>contains</strong>, for a partial match: see <a href="#partial">using the &rsquo;contains&rsquo; selection</a>;</li>
				<li><strong>starts with</strong>, for an exact match of the beginning: see <a href="#starts">using the &rsquo;starts with&rsquo; selection</a>;</li>
				<li><strong>ends with</strong>, for an exact match of the ending: see <a href="#ends">using the &rsquo;ends with&rsquo; selection</a>; or</li>
			 	<li><strong>is</strong>, for an exact match: see <a href="#exact">using the &rsquo;is&rsquo; selection</a>. <em>Keep in mind</em> 
			 	    that an exact match is exactly that, so typos must particularly be avoided with <strong>is</strong>.</li>
			 </ul>
	   </li>
		<li>In the third box enter the number or text you want fully or partially to match in the search.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Once you have selected all the criteria for the search, click the <strong>Search</strong> button. tcmIS will do the search and 
	display the matching records in a grid below the search form, or print a message that there is no matching data.</p>

<h2><a id="partial">Search contains</a></h2>
<p>A partial match (<strong>contains</strong>) looks for the text you enter anywhere in the field you selected. The record
   will be displayed if your text is a match at the beginning, at the end, or anywhere within the field value. In general a
	Contains search will return the largest possible number of records.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 2</div></div>

<h2><a id="starts">Search starts with</a></h2>
<p><strong>Starts with</strong> is a combination of a partial match and an exact match. The partial is the 'beginning' of the
   field value and the exact is that the beginning must be identical to the text you enter. If you enter three characters the
	search will find all those records where the field you selected begins with those three characters. If you were to select
	twenty characters, the search would find only records where the field selected begins with those twenty characters.</p>

<h2><a id="ends">Search ends with</a></h2>
<p><strong>Ends with</strong> is another combination of partial match and exact match. In this case the matching records are
   those that end with whatever text you enter in the field you select.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Searches4.png" height="376" width="656" alt="Search result for ends with" />
<div class="caption">Figure 4</div></div>

<h2><a id="exact">Search exact match</a></h2>
<p>An exact match (<strong>is</strong>) search will find only those records that are character-for-character identical to the
   text you enter in the field you select.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Even an unseen space at the end or the beginning will be enough to cause the search to 'miss' the record you want.</li>
   <li>Entering a text that is shorter than the value in the field you want will always result in no records being found.</li>      
   <li>Entering a text that doesn't exist in any record (for the specified field) will result in no records being found.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="search">Single search input box</a></h2>
<p>In some cases a page or report may be set up to search a set of data fields, seeking a <a href="#partial">&rsquo;contains&rsquo;</a> 
	match in <em>any</em> of the fields in the set, for whatever text or digits are entered in the input box. (The exact set of 
	fields will vary depending on the purpose of the page or report.)</p>
<p>In a few cases the single search input box uses the <a href="#exact">&rsquo;is&rsquo;</a> search and will not return a record if there is only 
	a partial match. Normally this is indicated in the help section for the form or page.</p>

<h2><a id="lookup">Lookup forms</a></h2>
<p>A Lookup form is used for finding particular data when filling out another form. Lookup forms are almost always invoked 
	by clicking on a small magnifying glass icon <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" width="21" height="16" alt="magnifying glass" />.
	tcmIS produces a child window to display the form, with a single <strong>Search</strong> input text box. Enter the 
	search text and click the <strong>Search</strong> button.</p>
<p>tcmIS will display the records that it finds, in the lower portion of the Lookup form child window. Click on the 
	row that has the record you want. (It will then be highlighted by a contrasting background color.) In the upper portion 
	of the form a link will appear that facilitates using the selected record for the primary form. Click on this link: the child 
	window will close and the data you had chosen will be inserted in to the primary form.</p>

<h2><a id="typeahead">Type ahead search</a></h2>
<p>A Type ahead search is used for finding particular data when filling out a form. As the desired text is entered into the 
	text box, tcmIS presents a drop-down list of valid values that match the entered text. As more text is entered the possible 
	matching values decrease. When the desired value is visible, click it on the drop-down list and it will be placed into 
	the text box.</p>
<p>This technique replaces lookup forms in some situations.</p>

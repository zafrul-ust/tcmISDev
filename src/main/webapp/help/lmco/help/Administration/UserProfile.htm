<h2>Financial Approver button</h2>
<p>The Financial Approver list is used to manage approval authority, spending limits, and approval limits for creating MR’s.

<h2>Order User Group button</h2>
<p>User groups are a way to associate sets of users who have particular responsibilities, or shared interests, for 
	specific materials. User groups are specific to a single facility but may have members from other facilities in some
   situations. The same User Group name (e.g., Acids) can therefore be used at more than one facility and
	even have members in common. For example, Tom Jones might be a member of the Acids user group at both
	Facility A and Facility B. User Groups can be used to limit who can order specific categories of material.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Order User Group</strong> button in the lower panel to open the <strong>User Group Permissions</strong> page in a child window.</p>

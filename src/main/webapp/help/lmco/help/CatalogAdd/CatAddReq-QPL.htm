<p>The <strong>QPL</strong> tab on the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> (Catalog Add Request) page is used to request and 
   manage additions or changes to the QPL (qualified products list) in tcmIS. The QPL tab specifics are shown when you first 
   <a href="CatAddReq.htm">open the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page</a> or  when you click on the <strong>QPL</strong> tab 
   when the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page is already open.</p>

<div style="width: 50em; padding: 0 .5em; margin: 0 2em;" class="messages">
	<p>Five individual tabs in the lower portion of the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page correspond to the basic elements of the Cat Add Req process.</p>

<p>The behavior and appearance of the <strong>Cat Add Req - QPL tab</strong> page will differ somewhat based on which of the 
	following links was clicked. All of these are described below.</p>
	<ul>
	  	<li>The links above the data grid on the <a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm">Catalog</a> page:

<div class="caption">Figure 1</div></div>

<h2><a id="ModifyQPL">Modify QPL</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Modify QPL</strong> process is used change the QPL assigned to a part number. 
	There are two links just below the <strong>QPL</strong> tab that are used in the Modify QPL process, and one context menu item.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong><a id="AddItem">Add Item</a></strong> link is used to begin a request for a new addition to the QPL.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Show Obsolete Items</strong> link is used to display any items that have been on the QPL but are no longer.</li>
		<li>A <strong>Fadeout From QPL</strong> menu item is used <a href="#fadeout">request inactivation</a> of and approved product from the QPL.</li>
	</ul>
<p>When the <strong>Add Item</strong> link is clicked tcmIS will open a child window to display the <strong>Search Global Item</strong> form. 
	(This is fundamentally a <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Lookup form</a>.)</p>	
<p>Enter information about the product in the <strong>Search Text</strong> box and click the <strong>Search</strong> button. tcmIS 
	will display all records that match or include the text in the <strong>Search Text</strong> box. In 
	addition there will be a <strong><a href="#NewMaterial">New Material</a></strong> link at the upper left 
	of the data grid which can be used to begin a request for material that is not yet in the catalog. </p>
<div class="image"><img src="SearchGlobalForm.png" width="631" height="342" alt="Search Global Form" />
<div class="caption">Figure 2</div></div>

<p>The desired material may already be in the catalog. If so, select that record and additional links will be placed 
	into the upper left of the data grid.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Add Item</strong> link will place the selected record into the Cat Add Req page, with a status of 
			 &rsquo;Pending Approval&rsquo;, and close the <strong>Search Global Item</strong> form and the child window that displays it.
			<ul>
				<li><em>Don't be confused by the fact that the term</em> <strong>Add Item</strong> <em>is used for the link on
						both this <strong>Search Global Item</strong> page and the preceding <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page</em>.</li>

		</li>
		<li>The <strong>New Packaging from: Item</strong> link will launch the <a href="#NewPackaging">New Package 
			 from Item</a> request process.</li>
		<li>The <strong>New Packaging from: Material</strong> link will launch the <a href="#NewPackaging">New Package 
			 from Material</a> request process.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether matching material is in the system, the <strong>New Material</strong> link remains available.</p>

<h3><a id="NewPackaging">New Packaging</a></h3>
<p>The two New Packaging processes, <strong>Item</strong> or <strong>Material</strong>, are fundamentally the same. In 
	fact, in some cases the item is the material, and vice versa. But both are available for those situations where they 
	are different and a choice has to be made.</p>
<p>If the product is found but a different size is desired, highlight the item by clicking anywhere on the line and click
   the appropriate <strong>New Packaging</strong> link. The <strong>Edit Item Info</strong> page will be opened in a new 
   window to allow you to specify details about the new packaging.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 4</div></div>

<p>Since you are working on an existing item or material and requesting only a different packaging for the QPL, most
   of the information is already shown on the form.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If known, enter the <strong>Shipping Weight</strong> and select the <strong>Units</strong> from the list at the 
		 top of the form.</li>
	<li>Enter the number of units in the <strong># Per Comp</strong> box at the bottom of the form. (The default is 1 which 
		 is already there. Change it if necessary.)</li>
	<li>Enter the Package size in the <strong>Size</strong> box and select the unit of measure from the <strong>Unit</strong>
	    list. The number of units should be the smallest individual Package that can be purchased. For drums, pails,
		 rolls, cans, etc., this is typically 1.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Package Style</strong> text box enter that information. (The <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm#typeahead">Type 
		 ahead</a> feature will help locate a valid style.)</li>

<h2><a id="NewPart">New Part from:</a></h2>
<p>There are four &rsquo;starting points&rsquo; for initiating a Catalog Add Request on the <strong>Catalog</strong> 
	(after a part or item is selected from the data grid) and they differ basically in the amount of information for 
	the new item which is already in tcmIS. All requests begin with certain information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Requestor</strong> is the currently logged in user.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Request Date</strong> is the day&rsquo;s date.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Facility</strong>, <strong>Work Area</strong>, and <strong>Catalog</strong> are those selected 
			 for the Catalog search on the page where the link was clicked.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Request</strong> [number] is assigned by tcmIS (in sequential order).</li>
	</ul>
<p>(<em>Some other information may have default values which may be changed in the request process</em>.)</p>
<p>The four starting points build on these values, supplying from the tcmIS database what is already on record for the item or 
	material. Click on whichever link best describes the situation for the new part request.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>New Part from: <strong><a id="beginning">Beginning</a></strong> starts with a clean slate. All information for the new part 
			 must be provided in the request process although some pieces of information may be looked up while 
			 completing the forms.</li>
		<li>New Part from: <strong><a id="part">Part</a></strong> populates the request forms with information on file for the 
			 selected <strong>Part</strong> and the remaining information must be provided in the request process, 
			 again some pieces of information may be look up.</li>
		<li>New Part from: <strong><a id="item">Item</a></strong> populates the request forms with 
			 information on file for the selected <strong>Item</strong> and the remaining information must be provided 
			 in the request process, again some pieces of information may be look up.</li>
		<li>New Part from: <strong><a id="itempackage">Item</a> (modify Pkg)</strong> populates the request forms with information on file 
			 for the selected <strong>Item</strong> and opens an <strong>Edit Item Info</strong> form to enter the 
			 details about the new packaging for the item. (See, also, information on this page for 
			 <a href="#NewPackaging">New Packaging</a>.)</li>
	</ul>
<div class="image"><img src="CatAddReq-QPL18.png" height="238" width="759" alt="Four New Part from: starting points" />
<div class="caption">Figure 18</div></div>

<p>Before you can specify the products and materials that are to be associated with the new part, you must specify
   information about the part itself on the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> form.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a part number in the <strong>Part No</strong> box. Be sure the part number you use does not duplicate an
	    existing part number, and that it conforms to your company's standards for a part number.</li>
	<li>Select the stocking method for the part from the <strong>Stocked</strong> list.
	<ul>
		<li>Select <strong>MM</strong> if the material should be stocked in the warehouse.</li>
		<li>Select <strong>OOR</strong> if the material should be Order on Request, or a non-stocked item.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If this part is replacing a previously cataloged part, enter that part number in the <strong>Replaces Part
	    No</strong> box. Use the <strong>Replacement Part</strong> lookup form by clicking the magnifying glass icon 
	    <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21" alt="magnifying glass" /> to the right of the 
	    <strong>Replaces Part No</strong> text box. See <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm#lookup">Lookup 
	    forms</a> for details.</li>
	<li>Enter a description of the material as it should appear in the catalog in the <strong>Description</strong> box.</li>
	<li>If appropriate, provide instructions for recertification of an item in stock using the <strong>Recert Instructions</strong> multi-line text box.
	<ul>
		<li>Explicitly state the maximum number of recertifications that can be done for the part in the <strong># Recert Allowed</strong> text box.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If incoming testing is required for the part, select the check box for <strong>Incoming Testing</strong> to record that.</li>
	<li><em>If the part is <strong>Production Material</strong></em>, enter the <strong>EMAP</strong> ID just below the
	    Production Material option buttons. (The text entry box is not there unless you have selected its <strong>Yes</strong> button.)</li>
	<li>Using the <strong>Time and Temp Sensitive</strong> option buttons and the <strong>Room Temp Out Time Required</strong>
	    option buttons, indicate if the material is time and temperature sensitive and whether room temp out time is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point in the process, you may save the new part record, or submit it, using the <strong>Save</strong> or 
	<strong>Submit</strong> links in the upper-left of the page. But the request is not finished until you</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Complete a <strong><a href="#ModifyQPL">Modify QPL</a></strong> by adding one or more products or materials to the QPL 
			 (not required except for New Part from Beginning, but allowed for other situations.)
			<ul>
				<li>This is required for <strong>New Part from: Beginning</strong>.</li>
				<li>this is optional for other <strong>New Part from:</strong> situations as the existing parts or items 
					 will already be in place with a status of <em>Pending Approval</em>.</li>

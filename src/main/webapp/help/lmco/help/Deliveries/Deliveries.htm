<p>The <strong>Deliveries</strong> page is used to view information about deliveries from HGI and access documentation 
	associated with the delivery such as certifications, receiving checklists, or supplier packing lists. The 
	<strong>Deliveries</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Reports</strong> menu by selecting 
	<strong>Deliveries</strong>. The	<strong>Deliveries</strong> page is launched in a new tab. (See also the 
	<strong><a href="../DeliveryConfirmation/DeliveryConfirmation.htm">Delivery Confirmation</a></strong> page.)</p>

<p>The first two selection criteria for your report allow you to select a facility from the <strong>Facility</strong> 
   list and a work area from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list. You may also leave either or both 
   set at the default values.</p>
<p>The <strong>Delivered Between</strong> input boxes allow you to specify a starting and/or ending date for the 
   deliveries you want to see reported. Clicking into either input box will cause a small calendar to be displayed 
   from which you may choose the date you want.</p>
<p>You must provide something to at least partially identify the material you want using the <strong>Search by</strong> boxes. 
	See <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button on the page to export the data in Excel format.</p>

<p>The <strong>Deliveries</strong> report contains a convenient link when there are any actual delivery receipt documents for a record uploaded
   into tcmIS by the HGI Hub (when the materials were received at the hub). These documents may include receiving checklists,
	 packing lists, certificates of conformance, or certificates of analysis. To the right of the Receipt number in the first column, a small 
	 &#39;document&#39; icon alerts you to the presence of an uploaded document for the record.</p>
<p>Right click anywhere on the row for the record you want and there will be a <strong>View Receipt Document</strong> menu item.
	Click on that and a new window will open to display a Receipt Document window. </p>
<p>In addition, right clicking on any record will provide a context menu item, <strong>Move to Another Work Area</strong>, for the process to transfer 
   material to another work area. </p>

<p>When you click on the <strong>Move to Another Work Area</strong> menu item, tcmIS will open a child window where you must detail the transfer. 
   There are two sorts of work area destinations for a transfer.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Some work areas have defaults but allow you to override the defaults. These defaults will be in normal type. There will be 
       multiple record rows to accommodate splitting the transfer among two or more charge numbers. (Even though multiple records are 
       permitted, often there will be only one for a particular destination.)</li>
   <li>Other work areas have a default set of charge information (one or more charge number records), set up so you cannot override it. 
       These records will be in bold type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to verifying or updating the charge information, and adding records for split transfers, you must also verify or provide other 
   information needed for the transfer.</p>
<ul>
   <li>You may use the <strong>to Work Area</strong> list to change the work area to which the transfer is to be made.</li>
   <li>You must use the <strong>Quantity</strong> text box to specify the quantity of the item to be transferred.</li>
   <li>If needed, use the <strong>Dock</strong> list to specify the dock for the transfer.</li>
   <li>If needed, use the <strong>Deliver to</strong> text box to specify the location within the work area for the transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>When splitting a transfer between two or more charge numbers, adjust the percentage for each row in the rightmost column so that all 
   altogether the percentages add to exactly 100.</p>
<p>When all the transfer information is provided, click on the <strong>Submit</strong> link in the upper-left corner of the window 
   to complete the transfer process. Before you ever click the <strong>Submit</strong> link, you may abandon the process and disregard 
   the transfer steps by clicking the <strong>Cancel</strong> link.</p>

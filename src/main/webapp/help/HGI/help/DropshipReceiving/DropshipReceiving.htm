<p>The <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page is used by HGI customers or staff to record the receipt of an order in
  tcmIS when the material was shipped directly to the customer's facility and did not pass through an HGI hub. The dropship
  receiving process essentially creates a receipt into inventory and a delivery against a Material Request in tcmIS all in
  one step. The <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu
  by selecting <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong>. The page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>There are a number of selections that define the search:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must use the <strong>Operating Entity</strong> and <strong>Hub</strong> drop-down lists to select those for which dropship 
		receiving will be performed. In some cases there is only a single <strong>Inventory Group</strong> associated with the Hub. In other 
		cases the <strong>Inventory Group</strong> drop-down list allows you to choose either the default <em>My Inventory Groups</em> or
		select one particular Inventory Group. If you do select a particular Inventory Group, there may be a further choice available in the 
		<strong>Ship To </strong> drop-down list of the default <em>All Docks</em> or you may choose one particular dock.</li>
	<li>You may provide something to at least partially identify the material you want using the <strong>Search by</strong> boxes. Your 
		search may be specified by <strong>Item Desc</strong>[ription], <strong>Item ID</strong>, <strong>MR Number</strong>, or 
		<strong>Haas PO</strong>. See <a href="#customerlookup">"below</a> and <a href="../Introduction/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</li>
	<li>You may specify the order in which the items are listed using the <strong>Sort</strong> list.
		<ul>
			<li>by date expected and, within date, by supplier when you select <strong>Date Exptd/Supplier</strong>;</li>
			<li>by Material Request line number when you select <strong>MR-Line</strong>;</li>
			<li>by Purchase Order and, within PO, by line when you select <strong>PO/PO Line</strong>;</li>
			<li>by supplier and, within supplier, by date expected when you select <strong>Supplier/Date Exptd</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>By default only orders expected to be delivered in the next 30 days are listed. To see more orders,
		increase the number of days in the <strong>Expected Within</strong> box.</li>
	<li>To limit the dropship receiving activity to items for a particular customer, click the magnifying glass icon 
		<img src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21" alt="magnifying glass" /> across from the <strong>Customer</strong> 
		label to open the <strong>Customer</strong> Lookup form. See <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm#lookup">Lookup forms</a> 
		for further information.</li>	
</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button on the page to export the data in Excel format.</p>

<p>The <a id="customerlookup">customer selection form</a> provides five different selections to specify exactly which customer is to be used for
	the dropship receiving activity. You may use any or all of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Customer ID</strong> search term always uses the <strong>is</strong> drop-down item to locate an exact match to any customer 
		 ID number entered.</li>
	<li>The remaining search terms,
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Customer Name</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Synonym</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Bill To</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Ship To</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="list-style-type: none;">allow you to choose the types of match: <strong>is</strong>; <strong>contains</strong>; <strong>starts with</strong>; or 
		 <strong>ends with</strong>. See <a href="../Introduction/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</li>
	<li><em>Do not use any combination that results in excluding the customer you want.</em> For example, there may be 
		no customer with a <strong>Bill To</strong> containing &#39;Florida&#39; and a <strong>Ship To</strong> containing 
		&#39;Kenya&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button, select the row with the customer you want, and click 
	the <strong>Return Selected Customer</strong> link that will appear at the top of the list. The 
	<strong>Customer</strong> will be added to the Dropship Receiving search form and included in
	the search criteria for that page.</p>

<p>You may view the Purchase Order (PO) by right-clicking on the line and selecting <strong>View Purchase Order</strong>. The PO is opened
  in a new window. See the <a href="../Purchasing/PurchaseOrders.htm">Purchase Orders</a> help information for details.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button on the page to export a list of open orders in Excel format.</p>

<p>When you have located the shipment you want to 'receive' (by entering details into tcmIS), use the input
   boxes on the selected line of the <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page to enter the needed details. 
   <em>Scroll the page to the left to view the columns if necessary.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Although the <strong>OK</strong> check box is the first field available for action, it is actually the
	   very last thing to do when receiving the order into tcmIS. Fill in all the other information before you
		select this box.</li>

	<li>Begin by entering the manufacturer's lot number from the material in the <strong>Lot</strong> column.</li>
	<li>If the supplier ship date is known, enter that date in the <strong>Actual Supplier Ship Date</strong>
	    column. Place your cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to
		 choose the date. This is not a required field and can be left blank if this information is not
		 provided by the supplier.</li>
	<li>Enter the actual date the material was delivered to your facility in the <strong>DOR</strong> ("date of
	    receipt") column. The date defaults to today's date which you may leave if that is correct. Click your
		 cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to choose another date
		 (but you may not use a date later than today). </li>
	<li>Enter the expiration date of the material in the <strong>Exp Date</strong> column. Place your
	    cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to choose the date. If
		 this is not a shelf life sensitive product, enter the word Indefinite by clicking the <strong>
		 Indefinite</strong> button at the bottom of the calendar form.</li>
	<li>Enter the quantity delivered in the <strong>Qty Rec'd</strong> column. <em>Note that it is very
	    important to receive material in terms of the unit of measure displayed in the packaging
		 field</em>.</li>
	<li>Enter any notes in the <strong>Notes</strong> text box. </li>
	<li>Provide the supplier's delivery ticket information in the <strong>Delivery Ticket</strong>
	    text box. </li>
	<li>Select the country of origin for the material from the <strong>Ship From Country</strong> list. </li>

</ul>

<p>If the material delivered has more than a single lot number or more than a single expiration date,
   split the shipment into enough lines to record each lot number and expiration date combination on
	a separate line. Click the <strong>Dupl</strong>[icate] button to add a split line, repeating
	until you have all the lines you need for the shipment. Complete all the required fields for each
	line.</p>

<div>Figure 6</div></div>

<p>Items are sometimes shipped in different quantities in different deliveries. These items are known as
   variably sized or MV items. For MV items on the <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page,
	you must enter both quantity and size in the <strong>Packaged Qty x Packaged Size</strong> column.
   If more than one size was delivered, use the <strong>Dup Kit/Pkg</strong> button as needed and enter the
   <strong>Packaged Qty x Packaged Size</strong> for each size.</p>

<div>Figure 7</div></div>

<p>Complete all the data entry for each line received. After all lines are complete, select the check box
   in the <strong>OK</strong> column for each completed line.</p>
<p>After all lines are marked OK, click the <strong>Receive</strong> link at the top left of the data
   grid to complete the process. Unchecked lines will be left for future action.</p>

<p>A summary of all receipts made is displayed. This page can be printed for your records by
   clicking the <strong>Print This Page</strong> button. If the customer is equipped with a Zebra printer, and
	it has been configured to work with tcmIS, container labels can be printed by clicking the 
	<strong>Container Labels</strong> button. Contact the Technical Center to enable label printing.</p>

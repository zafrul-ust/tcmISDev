<p>The <strong>New Supplier Request</strong> page is used to initiate new supplier records. The 
	<strong>New Supplier Request</strong> page is accessed by clicking on the <strong>New</strong> link 
	on the <strong>New/Modify Supplier Requests</strong> page. The <strong>New Supplier Request</strong> 
	page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>The <strong>New Supplier Request</strong> may also be accessed by clicking on the <strong>New Supplier</strong> 
	button on the <strong>Supplier Search</strong> page.</p>
<p><em>Use the <strong>Supplier Search</strong> page to determine if the supplier already exists in tcmIS 
   before requesting a new supplier record.</em></p>
<p>A new supplier record is not completed until all required information is provided and it has been
   reviewed and approved by new supplier approvers.</p>

<div>Figure 1A</div></div>

<p><em>The <strong>New Supplier Request</strong> form is quite long. In the figures below is has been broken 
	into sections for easier reference.</em></p>
<p>Required fields are denoted by an asterisk and information must be supplied for each of them. It is advisable 
	to provide other information insofar as possible.</p>
<p>The top of the form provides three action links and two address sections. All the information in the address 
	sections is required.</p>
<ul>

	<li>The <strong>Save</strong> link is used to preserve a newly created request before it is ready for submission
		 and approval. Once a request is Saved it will be stored with a <strong>Draft</strong> status until it is 
		 completed and submitted.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Submit</strong> link is used after the form is complete to submit the request for review by the new 
		 supplier approvers.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Delete</strong> link is used to discard a request that has not been submitted.</li>

</ul>
<p>Both address sections include the same required information (except the supplier name information is not 
	repeated.) Begin with the <strong>Country</strong> drop-down list so that the <strong>State/Province</strong> 
	drop-down list has the appropriate items.</p>	 
<p><em>If all the information in the <strong>Submit To</strong> section is the same as that provided in the 
	<strong>Address</strong> section</em>, simply select the <strong>Same As Above</strong> check box to copy the 
	information. Otherwise complete all the required fields.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="NewSupplier2.png" alt="New Supplier form - top" width="834" height="482" />
<div>Figure 2</div></div>

<p>The next two sections call for contact and business information.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Although the <strong>Federal Tax ID</strong> is not denoted with an asterisk, it is a required field. For suppliers 
		outside the U.S., use this field to enter the VAT number.
		<ul>
			<li>In some cases the Federal Tax ID is the supplier&#39;s personal Social Security Number. In this
				 case, select the check box to the left of <strong>SSN</strong>.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>The <strong>State Tax ID</strong> is optional but should be completed for suppliers in the U.S. if the number is 
		available from the supplier.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Type of Purchase</strong> from the drop-down list. This is typically <em>Chemical</em>. 
		 Other options include <em>Waste</em>, <em>Gas</em>, <em>Computer Hardware</em>, and <em>Other</em>.</li>

	<li>Select the supplier's <strong>Qualification Level</strong> from the drop-down list. New 
       suppliers should be set to <em>New</em>. If the customer has directed HGI to purchase from this 
       supplier select <em>Customer Directed-New</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div>Figure 3</div></div>

<p>The next two sections are small tables used to provided payment terms and payment terms exceptions. Both tables 
	originally have no information. To add information to either table, as appropriate, click the <strong>Add Line</strong> 
	link at the top of the table. tcmIS will insert a new line in the table where you may:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the <strong>Operating Entity</strong> for which this supplier will be used from the drop-down list 
		 that appears when you click into the text box.</li>
	<li><em><strong>For Exceptions only</strong></em> select the <strong>Inventory Group</strong> to which the 
			exception applies from the drop-down list that appears when you click into the text box.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Payment Terms</strong> the supplier has extended to the selecting Operating Entity 
		 from the drop-down list that appears when you click into the text box.
		 <ul>

		 	<li>If the payment terms needed are not listed, contact the Technical Center.</li>
		 </ul>
		 </li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a row click anywhere on the line and click the <strong>Remove Line</strong> link.</p>

<p>If the supplier has issued HGI an account number, enter it in the <strong>Haas Account Number</strong> 
	box.</p>	
<div class="image"><img src="NewSupplier5.png" alt="New Supplier form Accounting Info" width="835" height="159" />
<div>Figure 5</div></div>

<p>The <strong>Misc</strong>[ellaneous] section has several functions.</p>
<div style="float: none;">
<ul>
	<li>If this supplier replaces a previous supplier due to a name change, enter the old name in the 
		 <strong>Former Supplier Name</strong> text box.</li>

	<li>Enter any <strong>notes</strong> directed to new supplier approvers that should be included based on your 
		 team&#39;s specific work processes.</li>
	<li>Use the set of check boxes to indicate which of the various classifications apply to the 
		 supplier. (Mouse over any classification for more information.)

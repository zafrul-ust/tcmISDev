<h4><a id="ActiveStatus">Active status</a></h4>
<p>A Cabinet may be active or inactive. <span style="background-color: yellow;">If it is inactive it cannot place orders or add inventory.</span></p>
<p>On the <strong>Cabinet Definitions</strong> page data grid the first (left-most) column is the <strong>Active</strong>
   column. If the check box is selected for the line, the Cabinet on that line is active. If the box is cleared, the
	Cabinet is inactive.</p>
<h4>Cabinet <a id="CabinetName">Name</a> and <a id="CabinetGroup">Group</a></h4>
<p>Every Cabinet must have a name and must belong to a Cabinet group. The name uniquely identifies the Cabinet
   to distinguish it from all other Cabinets. The group on the other hand, clusters the Cabinet with others with
	which it is operationally or organizationally associated.</p>
<p>The Cabinet name may be edited directly in the text box in the <strong>Cabinet</strong> column. </p>
<p>The Cabinet group is identified in the <strong>Group</strong> column, within the <strong>Cabinet Group</strong>
   section of columns. To edit the Cabinet group, click on the magnifying glass icon <img src="../../images/glass.gif" 
   height="16" width="21" alt="magnifying glass icon" /> in the <strong>Lookup</strong> column right of the <strong>Group</strong> column.
   The <strong>Manage Cabinet Groups</strong> page will open in a new window.</p>
<p>No changes made on the <strong>Cabinet Definitions</strong> page are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link
   is clicked.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="CabinetDef2.png" height="466" width="857" alt="Cabinet Definitions Status column" />
<div>Figure 4</div></div>

<p>The <strong>Manage Cabinet Groups</strong> page simply lists all the existing Cabinet groups to which any
   particular Cabinet may be assigned. There are three things that can be done on this page.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong> one or more of the existing Cabinet group names. The Cabinet name may be edited
	    directly in the text box in the <strong>Cabinet Group</strong> column. No changes made on the <strong>Manage
		 Cabinet Groups</strong> page are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link on this page is clicked.</li>
	<li><strong>Create</strong> a new Cabinet group by clicking the <strong>New Cabinet Group</strong> link at the
	    upper-left of the page. A blank Cabinet group line will be added at the bottom of the list: you may have to
		 scroll down the list to see it. Enter a Cabinet name directly into the text box in the <strong>Cabinet
		 Group</strong> column. No changes made on the <strong>Manage Cabinet Groups</strong> page are saved until the
		 <strong>Update</strong> link on this page is clicked.</li>
	<li><strong>Assign</strong> a Cabinet group to the Cabinet you selected on the <strong>Cabinet
	   Definition</strong> page when you clicked the magnifying glass icon <img src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" 
	   width="21" alt="magnifying glass icon" />. A new link, <strong>Return Cabinet Group</strong>, will appear at the 
	   top of the page. Click this link.  The <strong>Manage Cabinet Groups</strong> page will close and the selected 
	   group will appear in the <strong>Group</strong> column. (Since you will be back on the <strong>Cabinet 
	   Definition</strong> page, remember, no changes made are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link is clicked.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="OrderingMethod">Ordering Method</a></h4>
<p>Ordering method specifies the means by which inventory may be obtained for the Cabinet. It is indicated and
   edited using the list in the <strong>Ordering Method</strong> column. There are three choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual Ordering</strong> indicates the replenishment occurs when a customer places an order using the
	    <strong><a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm">Catalog</a></strong> page.</li>
	<li><strong>Stock Level Ordering</strong> indicates the replenishment occurs when a <span style="red;">
	    <a href="../ScannerTraining/ScannerTraining.htm#CabinetScanning">Cabinet scan</a> </span>indicates that
	    additional inventory is needed.</li>
	<li><strong>Manual &amp; Stock Level</strong> indicates that both manual and stock level ordering are used for
	    obtaining needed inventory.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="InventoryGroup">Inventory Group</a></h4>
<p>On the <strong>Cabinet Definitions</strong> page data grid the <strong>Inventory Group</strong> column provides
   a list from which you may choose the appropriate inventory group for each work group.</p>
<p>No changes made on the <strong>Cabinet Definitions</strong> page are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link
   is clicked.</p>
<p><em>Not all organizations use inventory groups. If they are not used, the list in the
   <strong>Inventory Group</strong> column is replaced with a default text group name.</em></p>

<h4><a id="LocationInformation">Location Information</a></h4>
<p>On the <strong>Cabinet Definitions</strong> page data grid there are eight columns, in three groups, used to
   specify location information for the Cabinet:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Dock</strong> is the facility location for deliveries.
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Name</strong> column identifies the actual loading dock where the truck will come to deliver
		    the orders. One facility could have multiple docks.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Fixed</strong> column check box, when selected, indicates that there is a single dock which
		    must be used. If cleared there may be multiple docks and the user selects the dock when creating the
			 Material Request.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Delivery Point</strong> is the designated location within the facility for final delivery whether
	    by HGI driver or facility personnel.
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Name</strong> column identifies the designated location.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Fixed</strong> column check box, when selected, indicates that there is a single delivery
		    point which must be used. If cleared there may be multiple delivery points and the user selects the
			 delivery point when creating the Material Request.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Lookup</strong> magnifying glass icon <img src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21" 
		    alt="magnifying glass icon" /> is used to open the <strong>Manage Delivery Points</strong> page to view 
		    and manage <a href="#DeliveryPoints">Delivery Points</a> for a Cabinet.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Building</strong> more clearly defines the delivery point.
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Building</strong> is the specific building of the delivery point.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Room</strong> is the specific room of the delivery point. </li>
		<li>The <strong>Lookup</strong> magnifying glass icon <img src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" 
		    width="21" alt="magnifying glass icon" /> is used to open the <strong>Manage Building Rooms</strong> 
		    page to view and manage <a href="#BuildingRooms">buildings and rooms</a> for the delivery point.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong><a id="DeliveryPoints">Manage Delivery Points</a></strong> page simply lists all the existing delivery points to which any
   particular Cabinet may be assigned. There are five things that can be done on this page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activate or deactivate a delivery point by checking or unchecking, respectively, the box in the
	    <strong>Active</strong> column. <span style="background-color: yellow;">A deactivated (inactive) delivery point cannot be assigned to any Cabinet.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong> one or more of the existing delivery point names. The delivery point name may be edited

	    directly in the text box in the upper <strong>Building</strong> column or the lower <strong>Room</strong>
		 column on the page. No changes made on the <strong>Manage Building Rooms</strong> page are saved until the

<p>Selecting the <strong>Edit Cabinet Directed Charge</strong> menu item will open a window to display the Charge
   Information form. This form is used to edit the existing directed charge information for the
	<a href="../Cabinets/CabinetMgmt.htm#EditCharge">Cabinet</a> or the
	<a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm#EditCharge">part</a>.</p>
<p>If directed charges have been entered for both a part and the Cabinet, the part directed charge will be used
   rather than the Cabinet directed charge.</p>

<p>Items not assigned to the requestor's catalog may be allowed restricted use for evaluation purposes. 
   The approval process is similar, but much shorter than adding a new catalog part. Later, if desired, 
   the item can be converted to a catalog part.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Engineering Evaluation</strong> process may be begun from the Catalog page after a Search 
   is done using the <strong>Search Type</strong> of <strong>Item Catalog</strong>.</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>You must specify both the <strong>Facility</strong> and <strong>Work Area</strong> from the respective boxes 
   		 since an evaluation must be for a specific work area.</li>
		<li><em>You may restrict your search to items that have already been in the Engineering Evaluation process 
			 for your facility</em>. Select the <strong>Previous Eval orders for this facility</strong> check box.
			 <ul>
			 	<li>You may further specify that you want items that have been processed at your request (<strong>By me</strong>) 
			 		 and/or items that have been processed for the current work area (<strong>For this work area</strong>).</li>
			 </ul>
			 </li>
   </ul>
<p>There will be up to four action links on the top line of the data grid.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For a completely new item (not in the Item Catalog), click the <strong>Define new Item and Place Evaluation Order</strong> 
   to initiate the process.
   	<ul>
   		<li>If the search returned &rsquo;No Data&rsquo; this will be the only link available.</li>
   		<li>Similarly, this will be the only link available until a record is selected in the data grid. Three additional links 
   			 (below) will appear once a record is selected.</li>
   	</ul>
   </li>
   <li>For a previously evaluated item, select the item by clicking on the record and click the <strong>Place Evaluation 
   	 Order from selected item</strong> link.</li>
   <li>Two of the links are for initiating a new part request. These work in the same way as the identical links 
   	 available when doing a Part Catalog search. See <a href="../CatalogAdd/CatAddReq-QPL.htm#newpartfromitem">Cat 
   	 Add Req page: New Part from Item</a>.
   	<ul>
   		<li><strong>New Part from: Item</strong></li>
   		<li><strong>New Part from: Item (modify Pkg)</strong></li>
   	</ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>When either <strong>Place Evaluation Order</strong> link is selected tcmIS will open a new tab and display a version 
	of the <strong>Edit Item Info</strong> form used for viewing and managing details on an item. There is a narrow 
	left panel displaying some basic information as well as five buttons and a wide right panel for viewing, editing, 
	or providing details.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Section 1 of 2</strong> button causes Section 1 of the wider right panel to be displayed. 
			 This is the default display when the form is first shown.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Section 2 of 2</strong> button causes Section 2 of the wider right panel to be displayed.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Submit</strong> button is the last to be used: click it when all needed information for the 
			 Evaluation Order has been provided.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Save</strong> button will preserve an unsubmitted Evaluation Order for future use even though 
			 it is not yet submitted.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Delete</strong> button will discard the Evaluation Order.</li>
		<li>If the Item is a Kit there will be more than one tab at the top of the right panel, labeled <em>Component 1</em>, 
			 <em>Component 2</em>, etc. If it is not a kit there will be a single tab,  labeled <em>Component 1</em>.</li>
	</ul>
<p>On both sections, any information where the text box label has an asterisk (*) is mandatory. Other 
   information is not mandatory but the more information you can provide the easier the process may be. 
   (For existing Catalog Items the required, and some other information, is provided by tcmIS.) 
   Where called for, accept the default values or change them to the values needed for this item.</p>

<p>Use the manufacturer lookup form by clicking the magnifying glass icon <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" 
	width="21" alt="magnifying glass" /> to the right of the <strong>Manufacturer</strong> text box. See  
	<a href="../Administration/Searches.htm#lookup">Lookup forms</a> for more details.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the manufacturer name is not found in the list, close the <strong>Manufacturer Search</strong> form and 
			 enter the name manually.</li>
	</ul>
<p>After you have provided all the required information, as well as other information that helps identify the 
   product, you may request formal approval by clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>If you have inadvertently missed providing any required information you will get a small error message window. 
   		 The process will not continue until you have completed every required field.</li>
   </ul>

<p>When the item has been successfully submitted tcmIS will redisplay the Engineering Evaluation page (Section 1). 
   The Actions section in the lower left corner will no longer display the <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, 
   or <strong>Delete</strong> buttons. They are all replaced by a single <strong>Approval Detail</strong> button.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="EngEval4.png" height="220" width="822" alt="Approval Detail button shown" />
<div class="caption">Figure 4</div></div>

<p>Clicking on the <strong>Approval Detail</strong> button will cause a smaller window to be displayed superimposed 
   on the Section 1 display. Details of the status of the request as well as names of approvers, dates of any 
   approval (or rejection) actions, and approver comments are shown.</p>
<p>Close the <strong>Approval Detail</strong> window by clicking on the &rsquo;X&rsquo; in the upper-right corner.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="EngEval5.png" height="321" width="536" alt="Approval Detail window" />
<div class="caption">Figure 5</div></div>

<p>You may review the status of the request using the <a href="../OrderTracking/OrderTracking.htm">Order Tracking page</a>. 
   Search for the material or the request and right click on the record row when you find it. You may redisplay the 
   <strong>Approval Detail</strong> window or, by selecting the <strong>View/Approve Eval</strong> menu item, 
   display the Engineering Evaluation page for the request.</p>

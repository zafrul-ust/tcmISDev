<p>The <a id="CatalogPage"><strong>Catalog</strong> page</a> provides access to information on items (materials, chemicals) 
   approved for use in each facility and work area. It is used to create and submit requests (<strong>Material 
   Requests</strong>) for purchase and delivery of those items.</p>
<p>The <strong>Catalog</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu by selecting
	<strong>Catalog</strong>. It will be shown in its own tab.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Catalog1.png" height="237" width="835" alt="Catalog page menu item" />
<div class="caption">Figure 1</div></div>

<p>The first step in ordering an item is to locate it in the <strong>Part Catalog</strong>. (The <strong>Item Catalog</strong> 
   is used for items or parts not yet approved, and for ordering them for evaluation. See 
   <a href="../EngineeringEval/EngineeringEval.htm">Engineering Evaluation</a>.)</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Select the facility where the material will be used from the <strong>Facility</strong> list.</li>
	<li>Select the work area where the material will be used from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list.</li>
	<li>Select the Part catalog (Item catalog for evaluations) from the <strong>Search Type</strong> list.</li>
   <li>Enter details about the desired	material in the <strong>Search</strong> box. Search criteria can include 
       part number, HGI item ID, packaging, trade name, manufacturer, manufacturer's part number, or material description.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The more specific the information entered, the more the search is narrowed. Multiple words as a logical
   expression can also be used to refine a search (separate words by <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>,
	<strong>but not</strong>; for example, prc AND 1750). To search for <em>all</em> chemicals for
	a specific location, leave the <strong>Search</strong> box blank.</p>

   <ul>
   	<li>Click the <strong>Remove Charge Numbers</strong> link to delete the existing charge numbers (if 
   		 any) from the part record for this work area; or,</li>

<p>The <strong>Deliveries</strong> page is used to view information about deliveries from HGI and to access 
   documentation associated with the delivery such as receiving checklists or supplier packing lists. The 
   <strong>Deliveries</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Reports</strong> menu by selecting 
   <strong>Deliveries</strong>. The	<strong>Deliveries</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>The first two selection criteria for your report allow you to select a facility from the <strong>Facility</strong> 
   list and a work area from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list. You may also leave either or both 
   set at the default values.</p>
<p>The <strong>Delivered Between</strong> input boxes allow you to specify a starting and/or ending date for the 
   deliveries you want to see reported. Clicking into either input box will cause a small calendar to be displayed 
   from which you may choose the date you want.</p>
<p>You must provide something to at least partially identify the material you want using the <strong>Search by</strong> boxes. 
	See <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button to display the records. Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button to export the displayed data in Excel format.</p>

<p>In the first column of the data grid, titled <strong>Receipt</strong>, just right of the receipt number, a small icon representing a 
	sheet of paper <img class="small" src="../../images/paper.gif" width="21" height="21" alt="page icon" /> will indicate that there are one or more delivery 
	receipt documents for the record uploaded into tcmIS by the HGI Hub at the time the materials were received at the hub. Such documents may 
	include scanned receipts, receiving checklists, packing lists, certificates of conformance, or certificates of analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Right click anywhere on the row for a record to get a context menu item to <strong>View Receipt Document</strong>(s). Click on that 
	and a child window will open to display a Receipt Document window.</p>

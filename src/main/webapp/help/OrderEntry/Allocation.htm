<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The <b> Inventory Allocation</b> process is used 
  to allocate inventory to a material line on a Scratch Pad or Material Request. 
  TcmIS can automatically allocate material to a line on a Scratch Pad or Material 
  Request based on shelf life and specification requirements entered on the material 
  line. TcmIS will allocate first to inventory held in stock in the default inventory 
  group which meets the required shelf life and specification requirements entered 
  on the material line. Next, tcmIS will allocate to material on a confirmed Purchase 
  Order for the default inventory group. Next, tcmIS will allocate to open Buy 
  Orders for the default inventory group. If no material meeting the customer's 
  requirements is in stock, on order, or on a Buy Order, then a new Buy Order 
  will be generated and the material line will be automatically allocated to the 
  new Buy Order. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Tahoma">Note that allocations to Scratch Pads and Draft 
  Material Requests will only last 8 hours. After 10 hours, if an MR has not been 
  confirmed, the allocations will be dropped. Material cannot be allocated to 
  a Quote.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">To automatically allocate a specific MR line, 
  right-click on the line and select <strong>Auto Allocate Line</strong>.</font></p>

<p>The <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page allows you to determine the status of an Order (aka, Material Request or MR) in tcmIS. The
   <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page also provides a menu item to send a question to HGI about an order.</p>
<p>The <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page is accessed from the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> menu by clicking on the
	 <strong>Order Tracking</strong> menu item. The <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>The <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page allows you to tailor your search for requested materials and view their status.
   You must choose the customer for your search from the <strong>Customer</strong> list. You may narrow your search to items 
   shipped to a specific location by selecting it from the <strong>Ship To</strong> list, or leave that at the default of 
   <em>All</em> locations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using the <strong>Status</strong> selection box, you may choose to search for <em>All</em> orders, leave the default of 
		 <em>Open</em> orders, or request only <em>Complete</em>[d] orders.</li>
   <li>To locate orders from a specific time period, use the two fields labeled <strong>Order Date: From...To</strong>. Each time you place 
   	 your mouse cursor in one of these fields, the <a href="#dateselector"><strong>Date Selector form</strong></a> is displayed. You may 
   	 choose a date for <strong>From</strong>, <strong>To</strong>, or both.
		<ul>
			<li>Choose each date by clicking the date on the calendar. The dates selected will appear on the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page.</li>
			<li>For a specific date: enter the same date in both fields.</li>
			<li>For a date range: enter the earliest date in the left field and the latest date in the right field.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
   <li>To locate orders based on the promised ship date, use the two fields labeled <strong>Promised Ship Date: From...To</strong>. Each time you place 
   	 your mouse cursor in one of these fields, the <a href="#dateselector"><strong>Date Selector form</strong></a> is displayed. You may 
   	 choose a date for <strong>From</strong>, <strong>To</strong>, or both.
		<ul>
			<li>Choose each date by clicking the date on the calendar. The dates selected will appear on the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page.</li>
			<li>For a specific date: enter the same date in both fields.</li>
			<li>For a date range: enter the earliest date in the left field and the latest date in the right field.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You may provide something to at least partially identify the material you want using the <strong>Search</strong> 
	    boxes by providing partial or full text for the <em>MR</em> (material Request number), the <em>Catalog Item</em> [number], the 
		 <em>Customer PO</em> (which is the default selection), or the <em>Customer Part Number</em>. See 
		 <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button to begin the search. tcmIS will display the records it finds in a data grid 
	in the lower panel of the <strong>Order Tracking</strong> page.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="../../images/DateSelectorForm.png" height="240" width="189" alt="DateSelectorForm" />
<div>Figure 3</div></div>

<p>Click on the <strong>Show Legend</strong> link in the upper left of the data grid to see a small form which
   provides a key to the colors used to highlight the status of some lines.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="OrderTracking4.png" height="143" width="319" alt="Order Tracking page with data grid" />
<div>Figure 4</div></div>

<p>The data grid contains a single record on each row/line with values for the record in the named columns. This is a rather wide 
	grid so it will be necessary to scroll to the right to see information that does not fit on the initial display. Use the 
	scroll bar near the bottom of the panel to move your &#39;view&#39; of the data left and right as needed.</p>
<p>Right click in any column of any record and two things will happen.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The record row will be &#39;selected&#39;: this is visually indicated by the background of the row changing to a 
			 light purple color.</li>
		<li>A small &#39;context menu&#39; will be displayed: this menu allows you to choose one of three actions.</li>
		<li>A left click on a record will also select and highlight it but will not display the context menu.</li>
	</ul>

<div>Figure 5</div></div>

<p>On the context menu, selecting the <strong>Order Status</strong> menu item will open a child window and display an 
	<strong>Order Status</strong> form. There will be a record for every line in the order. (If there is only a single line 
	on the order, the <strong>Order Status</strong> form and the <strong>Order Line Status</strong> form (see below) will 
	display the same information.)</p>
<p>In addition to reading the information on this form, there are four actions you can take.</p>

			 appear superimposed on the form showing information about the CSR.</li>

			 displayed in a small box known as a &#39;tool tip&#39;.</li>
		<li>Right click on any data in the left half of the form for a context menu item to <strong>Print</strong> the record.</li>

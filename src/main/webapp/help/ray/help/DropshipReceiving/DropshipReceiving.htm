<p>The<strong> Dropship Receiving</strong> page is used by HGI customers to record
   the receipt of an order in tcmIS when the material was shipped directly to the customer's facility
	and did not pass through an HGI hub. The <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page is accessed from the <strong>Order
	Management</strong> menu by selecting the <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> menu item. The page is launched
  in a new tab.</p>

<p>There are a number of selections that define the search:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You must use the <strong>Company</strong>, <strong>Facility</strong>, and <strong>Ship To</strong> 
			 lists to specify the drop ship information you want.</li>
		<li>In some situations <strong>Ship To</strong> allows you to choose either all docks or one single dock.</li>
		<li>You may provide something to at least partially identify the material you want using the <strong>Search by</strong> boxes. Your 
		 	search may be specified by <em>Item Desc</em>[ription], <em>Item ID</em>, <em>MR Number</em>, or <em>Haas PO</em>. See 
		 	<a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</li>
		<li>You may specify the order in which the items are listed using the <strong>Sort</strong> list.
			<ul>
				<li>by date expected and, within date, by supplier when you select <strong>Date Exptd/Supplier</strong>;</li>
				<li>by Material Request line number when you select <strong>MR-Line</strong>;</li>
				<li>by Purchase Order and, within PO, by line when you select <strong>PO/PO Line</strong>;</li>
				<li>by supplier and, within supplier, by date expected when you select <strong>Supplier/Date Exptd</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>By default only orders expected to be delivered in the next 30 days are listed. To see more orders,
	    	increase the number of days in the <strong>Expected Within</strong> box.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button to display the records. Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button to export the displayed data in Excel format.</p>

<p>When you have located the shipment you want to 'receive' (by entering details into tcmIS), use the text
   boxes on the selected line of the <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page to enter the needed details.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Although the <strong>OK</strong> check box is the first field available for action, it is actually the
	   very last thing to do when receiving the order into tcmIS. Fill in all the other information before you
		select this check box.</li>
	<li>Begin by entering the manufacturer's lot number from the material in the <strong>Lot</strong> column.</li>
	<li>If the supplier ship date is known, enter that date in the <strong>Actual Supplier Ship Date</strong>
	    column. Place your cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to
		 choose the date. This is not a required field and can be left blank if this information is not
		 provided by the supplier.</li>
	<li>Enter the actual date the material was delivered to your facility in the <strong>DOR</strong>
	    column. The date defaults to today's date which you may leave if that is correct. Place your
		 cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to choose another date
		 (but you may not use a date later than today). </li>
	<li>Enter the expiration date of the material in the <strong>Exp Date</strong> column. Place your
	    cursor in the field and the Date Selector form will open to allow you to choose the date. If
		 this is not a shelf life sensitive product, enter the word Indefinite by clicking the <strong>
		 Indefinite</strong> button at the bottom of the calendar form.</li>
	<li>Enter the quantity delivered in the <strong>Qty Rec'd</strong> column. <em>Note that it is very
	    important to receive material in terms of the unit of measure displayed in the packaging
		 field</em>.</li>
	<li>Enter any notes in the <strong>Notes</strong> text box. </li>
	<li>Provide the supplier's delivery ticket information in the <strong>Delivery Ticket</strong>
	    text box. </li>
	<li>Select the country of origin for the material from the <strong>Ship From Country</strong> list. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the material delivered has more than a single lot number or more than a single expiration date,
   split the shipment into enough lines to record each lot number and expiration date combination on
	a separate line. Click the <strong>Dupl</strong>[icate] button to add a split line, repeating
	until you have all the lines you need for the shipment. Complete all the required fields for each
	line.</p>

<p>Items are sometimes shipped in different quantities in different deliveries. These items are known as
   variably sized or MV items. For MV items on the <strong>Dropship Receiving</strong> page,
	you must enter both quantity and size in the <strong>Packaged Qty x Packaged Size</strong> column.
   If more than one size was delivered, use the <strong>Dup Pkg</strong> button as needed and enter the
   <strong>Packaged Qty x Packaged Size</strong> for each size.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 5</div></div>

<p>Complete all the data entry for each line received. After all lines are complete, select the check box
   in the <strong>OK</strong> column for each completed line.</p>
<p>After all lines are marked OK, click the <strong>Receive</strong> link at the top left of the data
   grid to complete the process. Unchecked lines will be left for future action.</p>

<p>When the <strong>Receive</strong> link is clicked, in addition to updating the tcmIS record, a child window is opened 
	to display the <a id="receivedreceipts"><strong>Received Receipts</strong> form</a> which summarizes all receipts made.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the customer is equipped with a Zebra printer, and it has been configured to work with tcmIS, container/kit labels can 
			 be printed by clicking the <strong>Container Labels</strong> button. Contact the Technical Center to enable label printing.</li>
		<li>At HGI Distribution Hubs the <strong>Document Labels</strong> button is used to print labels that, affixed to receipt 
			 documents, automates the storage of scanned, labeled documents into tcmIS.</li>
		<li>This form itself can be printed for your records by clicking the <strong>Print This Page</strong> button.</li>
	</ul>
<p>In the <strong>Receipt ID</strong> column there is a small plus-symbol-in-a-box icon. Click on this icon 
	and tcmIS will open a child window to display the <strong>Receipt Documents</strong> form.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="DropshipReceiving7.png" alt="Received items summary page" height="319" width="709" />
<div class="caption">Figure 7</div></div>

<p>The <strong>Receipt Documents</strong> form displays a list of any documents that 
	have been uploaded and stored for this particular <strong>Receipt ID</strong> (if any. Management of uploaded 

	documents is handled from this form.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>View a receipt document by clicking on the <strong>Name</strong> which is a link that will open a new 
			 window to display the previously uploaded document.</li>
		<li>Select the check box in the <strong>Delete</strong> column to discard an existing receipt document. 

			 You must click the <strong>Update</strong> button to cause tcmIS to make any deletions.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Add New Document</strong> button to display another form for uploading an additional 
			 receipt document.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button to close the form and the window.</li>
	</ul>

<p>When the <strong>Add New Document</strong> button is clicked, tcmIS will open another child window and display 
	the Add Receipt Document form. All fields have to be completed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Accept the default Company or choose another (if desired and available) from the <strong>Company</strong> 
			 drop-down list.</li>
		<li>Enter a document name in the <strong>Doc Name</strong> text box.</li>
		<li>Accept the default date (which is always the current date) or choose another from the calendar form that 
			 is displayed when you click into the <strong>Doc Date</strong> text box.</li>
		<li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to locate the document to be uploaded for the <strong>File</strong> 
			 text box.</li>
		<li>Select the type of document from the <strong>Doc Type</strong> drop-down list: <em>COA, COC, Picture, or Receiving Checklist</em>.</li>

			 upload process.</li>

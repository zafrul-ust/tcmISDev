<p>The <strong>Catalog Add Tracking </strong> page enables users to view the status
  of a Catalog Add request. This page also allows approvers to locate Catalog
  Addition requests needing their approval.</p>
<p>The <strong>Catalog Add Tracking</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Order
   Management</strong> menu by selecting the <strong>Catalog Add</strong> menu item, then the
	<strong>Catalog Add Tracking</strong> menu item. The <strong>Catalog Add Tracking</strong> page
	is opened in a new tab.</p>

<p>The <strong>Catalog Add Tracking</strong> page allows you to tailor your search for requested
   materials and view their status. You may select all facilities for which you have authority by
	selecting <strong>My Facilities</strong> from the <strong>Facility</strong> box or
	select one specific facility; likewise, the work area can be all work areas for which you
	have authority by selecting <strong>My Work Areas</strong> from the <strong>Work
	Area</strong> box or select one specific work area.</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <strong>Requestor</strong> box can be used to limit the search to requests by a specific individual.
	    <em>There is no default Requestor.</em>
   <ul>
      <li>Leave the <strong>Requestor</strong> box blank to see requests regardless of who placed the request.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of the person who placed the request in the <strong>Requestor</strong> box to see only those
		    requests.</li>
      <li>You can look up a requestor with the <strong>Name Search</strong> form (see below) by clicking the magnifying
		    glass icon <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21"  alt="magnifying glass" /> .</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
   <li>Similarly, the <strong>Approver</strong> box can be used to limit the search to those requests that have to be approved by a specific individual.
	    <em>There is no default Approver (but see below on <a href="#MyApproval"><strong>Show all requests needing my Approval</strong></a>).</em>
   <ul>
      <li>Leave the <strong>Approver</strong> box blank to see requests regardless of who is supposed to approve.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of the person to approve the request in the <strong>Approver</strong> box to see only those
		    requests.</li>
      <li>You can look up an approver with the <strong>Name Search</strong> form (see below) by clicking the magnifying
		    glass icon <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21"  alt="magnifying glass" /> .</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Catalog Add request number can be entered in the <strong>Request ID</strong>
  box to locate a specific request.</li>
	<li>Checking the <strong>Show all requests needing my Approval</strong> box limits the search to only those requests needing
	    your approval (that is, approval by the logged in User Account; see below).</li>
	<li>The search can also be limited to only those requests in a certain status by selecting one
	    or more of the <strong>Status</strong> check boxes at the right.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Draft (New Material)</strong> selects only those requests still in draft status
		    and for addition of new material.</li>
		<li><strong>Draft (New Size/Pkg)</strong> selects only those requests still in draft status
		    and for addition of an existing material in a new size or new packaging.</li>
		<li><strong>Draft (New part No)</strong> selects only those requests still in draft status
		    and for addition of a new part number.</li>
		<li><strong>Draft (New Approval)</strong> selects only those requests still in draft status
		    and for a new work area approval of an existing material.</li>
		<li><strong>Pending TCM QC</strong> selects only those requests that have been submitted and await
		    completion by the HGI Catalog Team of gathering required data (including the MSDS) and validation
			 of the material with the manufacturer.</li>
		<li><strong>Pending Approval</strong> selects those requests that have been submitted and await
		    approval through your company's internal processes.</li>
		<li><strong>Pending Pricing</strong> selects only those requests that have been submitted
		    and await complete baseline pricing information.</li>
		<li><strong>Pending Catalog</strong> selects only those requests that have been submitted
		     and await final verification by the HGI Catalog Team of quality requirements (specifications) after all other approvals are
			  complete.</li>
		<li><strong>Ready to Order</strong> selects only those requests that have been fully approved and the materials are now available for ordering.</li>
		<li><strong>Rejected</strong> selects only those requests that have been disapproved in the request process.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>You may narrow the range of your catalog request search by using the three <strong>Search</strong> boxes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the first box choose whether to base the search on <strong>Part</strong>
	    (Raytheon part number), <strong>Part Desc</strong>[ription], [HGI] <strong>Item ID</strong>, or
		 [Catalog Add] <strong>Request ID</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the second box specify whether the search is for an exact match, using
	    <strong>is</strong>, or a partial match, using <strong>contains</strong>. <em>Keep in
		 mind</em> that an exact match is exactly that, so typos must be avoided with <strong>is</strong>.</li>
   <li>In the third box you enter the number or description you want fully or partially to match in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search for requests by clicking the <strong>Search</strong> button.</p>

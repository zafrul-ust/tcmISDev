<p>The Catalog Addition process is used to request additions or changes to the qualified products list
   (QPL) in tcmIS and begins on the <strong>Catalog</strong> page. From the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu
	select the <strong>Catalog</strong> menu item. The <strong>Catalog</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>In order to use the Catalog Addition process, it is important to understand the relationship between the "parts" you
   use and the "products" manufacturers provide because they are slightly different concepts. Every part in tcmIS has a
	unique part number. That number is associated with a QPL (qualified product list) that identifies all the manufacturer
	products encompassed by the part number. That is, a single part number may represent one, two, or more distinct
	'products.' These products may differ as to packaging, usage, and even naming, but all are approved by your company
	for the QPL for your part number.</p>
<p>The Catalog Addition process allows you to request changes to those parts for which you have responsibility, as well as
   to request changes to some aspects of the products themselves on the QPL. Once you make a request, your company
	internal processes, as well as the HGI processes, see to it that the changes meet company requirements and are
	acceptable across the company. When that occurs, the request is approved; if there is a problem the request is
	rejected.</p>
<p>Even though the process begins with the <strong>Catalog</strong> page, most of the process is handled on additional pages. The basic
   pages for the Catalog Addition process are the <strong><a href="CatAddReq.htm">Cat Add Req</a></strong> (Catalog Addition
	Request) and the <strong><a href="CatalogAddTracking.htm">Catalog Add Tracking</a></strong> (Catalog Addition
	Tracking) pages but there are others.</p>
<p>There are four types of Catalog Addition requests each with its own link. (Only the <strong>New Part</strong> link is
   displayed until you select an item line in the data grid.)</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="CatAddReq.htm#ModifyQPL"><strong>Modify QPL</strong></a> - request an addition <span style="color: red; font-weight: 900;">or change</span> to the list of products
	    (qualified products list) assigned to a part number.	</li>
	<li><a href="CatAddReq.htm#NewPart"><strong>New Part</strong></a> - request a new part number when the material or product for the part is not yet in tcmIS.</li>
	<li><a href="CatAddReq.htm#fromcurrent"><strong>New Part from current Part</strong></a> - request a new part number based on a part number which already exists in tcmIS.</li>
	<li><a href="CatAddReq.htm#WorkAreaApproval"><strong>New Work Area Approval</strong></a> - request an approval or restriction on use of a part for a specific work
	    area or set of work areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Catalog page, select the Facility and Work Area for which you want to make changes and use the search to
   locate the part number which you want to modify. Click the part number line to select it. Once you choose any part
	by selecting its line, the <strong>Modify QPL</strong>, <strong>New Part from current Part</strong>, and <strong>New
	Work Area Approval</strong> links become available.</p>
<p>Click whichever of the four links (above the data grid) that best fits your situation to begin the Catalog Addition process.
   The <strong><a href="CatAddReq.htm">Cat Add Req</a></strong> page will be opened in a new tab.</p>

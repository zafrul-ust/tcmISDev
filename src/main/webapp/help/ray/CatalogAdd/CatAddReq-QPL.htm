<p>The <strong>QPL</strong> tab on the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> (Catalog Addition Request) page is used to
   request and manage additions or changes to the qualified products list (QPL) in tcmIS.</p>
<p>QPL is shown by default upon <a href="CatAddReq.htm">opening the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page</a> or
   by clicking on the <strong>QPL</strong> tab when the page is open.</p>

<p>As you can see there are four individual tabs in the lower portion of the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page which display
   different sets of information. The tab in use (active) at any time is shown with white lettering on a dark background; the
	inactive tabs are shown with dark lettering on a light background.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>QPL</strong> - the default tab shown when the page is first loaded, used to view and manage products on
	     or being requested for the QPL.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="CatAddReq-UseApproval.htm">Use Approval</a></strong> - used to view and manage use permissions on products on
	     the QPL.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="CatAddReq-Spec.htm">Spec</a></strong> - used to view and manage specifications for the products on
	     the QPL.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="CatAddReq-Flowdown.htm">Flowdown</a></strong> - used to view and manage flowdowns for the products
	     on the QPL.</li>
<!--	<li><strong><a href="CatAddReq-HMRF.htm">HMRF</a></strong> - used to view and manage Hazardous Material Review Form
	     information for the products on the QPL.</li> -->
</ul>

</div>

<p>When the Cat Add Req page is opened it will be 'set up' to handle the type of Catalog Addition that you selected on the
   <strong>Catalog</strong> page, the link that you selected. All four possibilities are listed here.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#ModifyQPL"><strong>Modify QPL</strong></a> - request an item be added to, or <a href="#fadeout">removed from</a>, the list of products
	    (qualified products list) assigned to a part number.</li>
	<li><a href="#NewPart"><strong>New Part</strong></a> - request a new part number when the material or product for the part is not yet in tcmIS.</li>
	<li><a href="#fromcurrent"><strong>New Part from current Part</strong></a> - request a new part number based on a part number which already exists in tcmIS.</li>
	<li><a href="#WorkAreaApproval"><strong>New Work Area Approval</strong></a> - request an approval or restriction on use of a part for a specific work
	    area or set of work areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="ModifyQPL">Modify QPL</a></h2>
<p>The first type of Catalog Addition is the Modify QPL. There are three ways to modify the QPL. </p>
	 <ul>
	 	<li><strong><a href="#AddItem">Add Item</a></strong> is used to request a material or product already in tcmIS be added.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="#NewPackaging">New Packaging</a></strong> is used to request a different size Package of a material or
		    product already in tcmIS be added.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="#NewMaterial">New Material</a></strong> is used to identify and request a new material or
		    product for the QPL.</li>
	 </ul>

<h3><a id="AddItem">Add Item</a></h3>
<p>To add an additional product or material to the QPL, on the <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page (Figure 1) click the
   <strong>Add Item</strong> link immediately below the <strong>QPL</strong> tab. The <strong>Search Global Item</strong>
	page will open in a new window.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="CatAddReq2.png" height="212" width="729" alt="Search Global Item form" />
<div>Figure 2</div>
</div>

<p>Use the <strong>Search Global Item</strong> page to locate the product you want to add to the QPL. Enter
   information about the product in the <strong>Search Text</strong> box and click the <strong>Search</strong> button.
	(Only the <strong>New Material</strong> link is displayed until you select an item line in the data grid.)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="CatAddReq3.png" height="405" width="729" alt="Search Global Item data grid" />
<div>Figure 3</div>
</div>

<p>If you find the exact product, select it by clicking anywhere on the line. Click the <strong>Add Item</strong> link at the
	top left of the data grid to close the form (and window). The product will be added as a line on the QPL tab of the
	<strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page with a status of 'Pending Approval'.</p>
<p><em>Don't be confused by the fact that the term</em> <strong>Add Item</strong> <em>is used for the link on
	both this <strong>Search Global Item</strong> page and the preceding <strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page</em>.</p>
<p>If you do not find the product you want, you may have to add it as a <strong><a href="#NewPackaging">New Packaging</a></strong> or
   <strong><a href="#NewMaterial">New Material</a></strong> to modify the QPL.</p>
<p>See <a href="#Finalizing">Finalizing a QPL modification request</a></p>

<p>If the product or material has only this one component, click the <strong>Submit</strong> link at the top left of the page
   to close the form (and window). The product in the new packaging configuration will be added as a line on the QPL tab of the
	<strong>Cat Add Req</strong> page with a status of 'Pending Approval'.</p>

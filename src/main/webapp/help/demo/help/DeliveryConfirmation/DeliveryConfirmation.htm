<p>The <strong>Delivery Confirmation</strong> page is used to manually confirm deliveries after they have been received, and
	to view any comments that have been entered on received deliveries. The <strong>Delivery Confirmation</strong> page can be 
	accessed from the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu by selecting <strong>Delivery Confirmation</strong>. The	
	<strong>Delivery Confirmation</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>The <strong>Facility</strong> list allows you to specify the facility for which you want to enter or see delivery 
	information.</p>
<p>The <strong>Shipment ID</strong> text box allows you to specify the exact shipment you want to see.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Shipment ID</strong> text box uses the <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm#exact">’is’ search</a>  
			 (exact match) and will not return a record if there is only a partial match.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The <strong>Ship Date: From </strong> and <strong>To</strong> input boxes allow you to specify a starting and/or ending date for the 
   deliveries you want to see reported. Clicking into either input box will cause a small calendar to be displayed 
   from which you may choose the date you want.</p>
<p>You may include records of shipments already marked as Delivered by selecting the check box for 
	<strong>Show Confirmed</strong>.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button on the <strong>Catalog Add Tracking</strong>
  page to export results in Excel format.</p>

<p>To acknowledge receipt of a delivery, locate the Shipment ID and select the check box in the OK column for that record. You may also 
	click into the <strong>Comment</strong> column to add remarks. tcmIS will open a multi-line text box to allow you to type whatever 
	you need to include.</p>
<p>When all the receipt information is provided, click on the <strong>Confirm</strong> link in the upper-left corner of the window 
   to complete the process. You may wait to click the <strong>Confirm</strong> link until you have entered receipt information for 
   multiple shipments if you wish.</p>
<p>Before you ever click the <strong>Confirm</strong> link, you may abandon the process and disregard 
   the transfer steps by simply closing the page without ever clicking <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p>

<p>When you choose to include <strong>Show Confirm</strong>ed records, a <strong>Confirmed By</strong> column is added to the 
	data grid (even if no Confirmed records are actually found). As you would expect, the ID of the person who added the confirmation 
	is shown on that column for the confirmed record.</p>

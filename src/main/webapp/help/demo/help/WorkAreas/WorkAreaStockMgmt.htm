<p>The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is used in tcmIS to view and manage parts in work areas: 
	activate and inactivate parts; set stocking levels; and add parts to work areas. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page can be
	accessed from the <strong>Supply Chain</strong> menu: choose <strong>Work Area Inventory</strong> and select the
	<strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> menu item. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is launched
	in a new tab.</p>

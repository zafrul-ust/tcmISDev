<p>The <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page is used to view, manage, and print information about work areas
   set up in tcmIS. The <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Supply Chain</strong>
	menu by selecting the <strong>Work Area Inventory</strong> menu item, then the <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> item. 
	The <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>You must choose a specific facility for the work area(s) from the <strong>Facility</strong> list. You may
   choose to narrow the range of work areas by selecting from the <em>Physical Layout</em> portion of the selection 
   panel and/or from the <em>Organizational Layout</em> section.</p>
   <ul>
   	<li><em>Physical Layout</em>: refers to the physical location of the Work Area.
   		<ul>
   			<li>You may select a specific Area from the <strong>Area</strong> list.</li>
   			<li>You may also further narrow the selection by selecting a specific building from the <strong>Building</strong> list.</li>
   		</ul>
   	</li>
   	<li><em>Organizational Layout</em>: refers to the work area position in the company hierarchy.
   		<ul>
   			<li>You may select a specific work area from the <strong>Work Area Group</strong> list.</li>
   			<li>You may select a specific department from the <strong>Dept.</strong> list.</li>
   		</ul>
   	</li>
   </ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button. The work areas will be displayed in the data grid. (Because the grid
   includes so many columns it is illustrated in left and right sections, below.) </p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button to export results in Excel format.</p>

<p>The <strong><a id="manageworkareagroups">Work Area Groups</a></strong> page simply lists all the existing work area groups to which any
   particular work area may be assigned. There are three things that can be done on this page.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong> one or more of the existing work area group names. The work area name may be edited
	    directly in the text box in the <strong>Work Area Group</strong> column. No changes made on the <strong>Manage
		 Work Area Groups</strong> page are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link on this page is clicked.</li>
	<li><strong>Create</strong> a new work area group by clicking the <strong>New Work Area Group</strong> link at the
	    upper-left of the page. A blank work area group line will be added at the bottom of the list: you may have to
		 scroll down the list to see it. Enter a work area name directly into the text box in the <strong>Work Area
		 Group</strong> column. No changes made on the <strong>Manage Work Area Groups</strong> page are saved until the
		 <strong>Update</strong> link on this page is clicked.</li>
	<li><strong>Assign</strong> a work area group to the work area you selected on the <strong>Work Area
	   Definition</strong> page when you clicked the magnifying glass icon <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" 
	   width="21"  alt="magnifying glass" />. A new link, <strong>Return Work Area Group</strong>, will appear at the 
	   top of the page. Click this link.  The <strong>Manage Work Area Groups</strong> page will close and the selected 
	   group will appear in the <strong>Group</strong> column. (Since you will be back on the <strong>Work Area 
	   Definition</strong> page, remember, no changes made are saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link is clicked.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>M1</strong> through <strong>M6</strong> columns display the quantity dispensed from the cabinet in each of the previous six months (from 
	    oldest to most recent).</li>
	<li>The <strong>Half-year Total</strong> is simply the sum of the previous six month totals.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Avg User per Week</strong> is the Half-year Total divided by the 26 weeks in the six months.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Turns</strong> is an annualized projection based on the <strong>SL</strong> (stocking level). For 
	    the given SL and at the average user per week, <strong>Turns</strong> is the number of times the inventory 
	    will be completely replaced.</li>

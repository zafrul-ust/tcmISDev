<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Buy Orders are generated by tcmIS as the result of a Material 
  Request by the client for an Order On Request item or to restock the warehouse 
  when on hand quantities for a Min/Max item fall below the minimum stocking level. 
  The Buy Order directs the buyer to obtain material via Purchase Order to a supplier.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Buyers are responsible for securing 
  materials at competitive prices while meeting all quality requirements of the 
  client. The Procurement Department has a goal of 2 days for placing a Purchase 
  Order once a Buy Order is received.</font></p>

 
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Information on Buy Orders can be found from the 
  <strong>Supply Chain</strong> menu under <strong>Purchasing</strong>. Select 
  <strong>Buy Orders </strong> to display the <strong>Buy Orders page.</strong>

  All Purchase Orders must be created from the <strong> Buy Orders</strong> page.</font></font></p>

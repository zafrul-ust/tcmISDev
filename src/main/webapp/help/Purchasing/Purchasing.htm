  by tcmIS as the result of a material request by the client for an Order On Request 
  or to restock the warehouse when on hand quantities for a Min/Max item fall 
  below the minimum stocking level. The Buy Order directs the buyer to obtain 
  material via Purchase Order.</font></p>

  at competitive prices while meeting all quality requirements of the client. 
  </font></p>

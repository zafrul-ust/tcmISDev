  used by your hub as part of the Haas TCM ISO quality process. The receiving 
  checklist is used to record the receipt of materials ordered through tcmIS. 
  The receiving checklist is uniquely identified by a Purchase Order number and 
  a Line Item number. Prior to receiving materials, the receiving checklist is 
  printed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The receiving checklist can be printed from the 
  <strong>Receiving </strong>page. This page can be accessed from the <strong>Supply

  book materials into inventory at a hub. Receiving a </font><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Purchase 
  Order</font><font size="-1" face="tahoma"> also indicates that the supplier 
  invoice can be matched for payment. All materials that arrive at the hub should 
  be received using this page.</font></p>

<h5><font face="Tahoma"><a name="ReceivingChecklist"></a>Receiving Checklist</font></h5>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The receiving checklist is a tool that may be 
  used by your hub as part of the Haas TCM ISO quality process. The receiving 
  checklist is used to record the receipt of materials ordered through tcmIS. 
  The receiving checklist is uniquely identified by a Purchase Order number and 
  a Line Item number. Prior to receiving materials, the receiving checklist is 
  printed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The receiving checklist can be printed from the 
  <strong>Receiving </strong>page. This page can be accessed from the <strong>Supply 
  Chain</strong> Menu. Select <strong>Stock Room Operations</strong>. Under <strong>Receiving</strong>, 
  choose <strong>Receiving.</strong></font></p>

<h5><font face="Tahoma"><a name="Documentation"></a>Documentation</font></h5>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Documentation accompanying the receipt of each 
  Purchase Order may include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Bill of Lading</font></li>
  <li><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Packing List</font></li>

  <li><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Miscellaneous Paperwork</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">These documents are included with the receiving 
  checklist and together constitute a Receiving Jacket. The Receiving Jacket serves 
  as the physical record of Purchase Orders and as the quality document of the 
  materials. The Receiving Jacket should be optically scanned and saved for upload 
  into tcmIS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">MSDS documents are optically scanned by the Catalog 
  Group in Austin, Texas. The MSDS documents are made available to Haas TCM clients 
  as electronic images. Each client has a separate web page to look up MSDS documents. 
  The URL for the MSDS pages have the following format: https://www.tcmis.com/tcmIS/&lt;client&gt;/Msds. 
  </font><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Upon receipt of a Purchase Order with an 
  enclosed MSDS, Haas TCM hub personnel compare the revision date on the MSDS 
  with the revision date of the electronic image. If the MSDS has a more recent 
  date, it is forwarded to the Catalog Group to update the electronic image.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The lot number of the material should be entered 
  in the text box in the <b>Lot </b>column. The lot number may be found on the 
  receiving checklist. In some cases, there may be multiple lots for a single 
  receipt. In this case, make a duplicate record by clicking the <b>Dupl </b>button 
  located at the far right of the receipt line. The receipt line is duplicated, 
  creating two records which can be used to assign multiple lot numbers or lot 
  statuses to a single shipment. The <b>Lot</b> field must be populated and cannot 
  be blank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The actual date the supplier shipped the material 
  should be recorded in the <b>Act Supp Ship Date </b>column.<b> </b> This date 
  should come directly from the shipping documents that are received with the 
  material. If this date is not known, this field may be left blank. However, 
  this information is used in supplier report card metrics and should be populated 
  if possible in order to give feedback to the supplier about their performance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The date the material was received at the hub 
  should be entered in the <b>DOR</b> column. The current date will automatically 
  be populated in this field. If the material was received at the hub prior to 
  the date the receipt is actually being performed, the actual date the material 
  was received should be entered in place of the current date. This information 
  is also used in supplier metrics and should be entered accurately.</font><font face="Tahoma" size="-1"></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The date the material was manufactured should 
  be recorded in the <b>DOM</b> column. This date should be available on the shipping 
  documents that are received with the material. If no date is available, this 
  field can be left blank. However, often the shelf life of a material is calculated 
  using the date of manufacture so this information should be entered if available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The date the manufacturer shipped the material 
  (typically to a supplier) should be entered in the <b>Manufacturer DOS</b> column. 
  This date may be found in the shipping documents that are received with the 
  material. If this information is not available, this field may be left blank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The expiration date of the material should be 
  recorded in the <b>Exp Date</b> column. This date is typically determined according 
  to procedures and business rules of each client. In some cases, data from the 
  <b>Shelf Life</b> field of the receiving checklist can be used with the shipping 
  documents to determine an expiration date. If the material has no expiration 
  date, enter either the word <b>Indefinite</b> or the date <b>01/01/3000</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">The quantity received of each lot or lot status

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Some items in tcmIS are considered to be variable 
  sized items, also known as MV items. An MV item would be created when the manufacturer 
  does not always fill the container to the same volume each time. An MV item 
  would also be created if the material is an roll which is shipped with varying 
  lengths.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">When an MV item is displayed on the <strong>Receiving

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This screen displays to current status of all waste container transfer requests. The transfer request date is shown in the second column. Once the transfer is complete,
and the waste is in the 909-day storage area, then the box marked</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Transferred</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">is checked by the 90-day area
manager (access to this box will only be granted to the 90-day operator or their designee). This indicates that waste has already been moved from the point of generation to the 90-day generator
storage area. Upon</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Update Now</font><font face="Arial" size="2">, the container will no longer appear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In many cases the waste container is <i>created</i> in the 90-day area by consolidating waste into a drum or other container in the storage area. In this case, the
Waste Manager can check the Transferred box on the Waste Management Request screen while generating the request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can search for waste containers that were picked up from the point of generation within a specified time period by checking the box by</font> <font face="Arial"
size="2" color="#ff0000">Picked up within ______ Days</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">and indicating in the window the time period you wish to view.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If a request was not submitted - the requestor did not click the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Submit</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button on
the Waste Request Pickup screen - then it will be held as a draft request. No date appears in the request date column for draft requests. The requestor can go back and complete the draft request, and
submit it, by highlighting that line then clicking the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Waste Request Detail</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button. The same button can be used
to view details on any of the waste requests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The Waste Manager is allowed to modify the pickup date by double-clicking on that column and modifying the date.</font></p>

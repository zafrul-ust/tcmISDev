  <h2>Chemicals<a name="Chemicals"></a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to tcmIS (Total Chemical Management Information System), the web-based 
    chemical management information system. This section describes how to use 
    tcmIS to create material or chemical requests. This includes ordering and 
    tracking chemicals, inventory tracking, and adding new chemicals to the catalog. 
    After logging on by entering a valid <b>User Name</b> and <b>password</b>, 
    the Chemical Catalog Screen will be displayed. </p>
  <p>To access the Chemical and Gas Catalog from elsewhere within tcmIS, select 
    the<b> &quot;Chemical</b>&quot; button from the Tool Bar as shown below. </p>
  <p><img src="menu5.gif" width="580" height="97"></p>
  <p>The Chemical and Gas Catalog can also be accessed by selecting &quot;<b>Chemical 
    Catalog</b>&quot; from the Application Menu as shown below.</p>
  <p><img src="menu6.jpg" width="167" height="425"></p>
  <h3><a name="chemcat"></a>Chemical and Gas Catalog</h3>
  <p>The Chemical and Gas Catalog contains information on materials approved for 
    use in the specified facility and work area. There are currently two types 
    of catalogs. The Part Catalog describes all materials and their requirements 
    that have been defined for the specified facility and/or work area as well 
    as any ordering restrictions. The Item Catalog is more general and represents 
    all chemicals defined by manufacturers that have been ordered by any Haas 
    TCM customer.</p>
  <p><img src="chem1.jpg" width="765" height="568"></p>
  <h4><a name="partcat"></a>Part Catalog</h4>
  <p>The first step in ordering a chemical is to search for it in the Part Catalog. 
    Any information known about the desired material can be entered in the Search 
    box. This includes Customer Part Number, Haas TCM’s Part Number, Packaging, 
    Trade Name, Manufacturer, Manufacturer's Part Number, or Material Description. 
    The more specific the information entered, the more the search is narrowed. 
    Multiple words as a logical expression can also be used to refine a search 
    (separate words by <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b>, <b>NOT</b>; e.g. acetone <b>AND</b> 
    cleanroom). To search for <i>all</i> chemicals for a specific location, leave 
    the Search box blank and click the "<b>Search</b>" button. </p>
  <p>Some additional constraints can be added to a search of the Part Catalog. 
    Choosing the "<b>Active for selected Facility/Work Area</b>" radio button 
    displays only those chemicals associated with the specified facility and work 
    area. Checking the "<b>Approved Only</b>" box limits the search to only those 
    chemicals approved for the specified facility and work area. </p>
  <p> Selecting the "<b>All Catalogs</b>" radio button displays chemicals for 
    all catalogs associated with a customer. This feature can be useful when <a href="#catadd">searching 
    for a new material</a>. Checking the "<b>Active Only</b>" box limits the search 
    to only those chemicals that are currently active. A chemical is inactive 
    if it becomes obsolete for the part number, is no longer manufactured, or 
    is not yet approved for the part number.</p>
  <p>The Part Catalog is divided into three sections. The columns in blue and 
    white represent the part details and include Catalog, Customer Part Number, 
    Part Description, Stocking Type (MM or OOR), Shelf Life, and Price. The first 
    two columns in green and white represent the item details pertaining to the 
    part. The rest of the columns give component level details such as Packaging, 
    Manufacturer, and Approval Status. </p>
  <p><img src="chem2.jpg" width="994" height="494"></p>
  <p>More information can be obtained for a specific chemical by left clicking 
    anywhere on the line so the line is highlighted, then right clicking on the 
    part details to display a menu of additional selections. These selections 
    include information regarding the Part Inventory, Item Inventory, Reorder 
    Point, Stocking Level, Specifications, and Approved Work Areas. </p>
  <p><img src="chem3.jpg" width="746" height="302"></p>
  <p>To find our more about the inventory of a particular item, select the item 
    and right click the item details. Select &quot;<b>Inventory Detail</b>&quot;. 
    Typically only Min/Max items will have have information in the Inventory Detail 
    Screen. On hand inventory is displayed on the left side of the Inventory Detail 
    Screen. On order items are displayed on the right side of the Inventory Detail 
    Screen.</p>
  <p><img src="chem28.jpg" width="716" height="376"> </p>
  <p>Comments can also be added to a particular part by right clicking on the 
    part details. When a comment is added to a particular part, the comment is 
    saved. Any saved comments will be displayed every time that part is being 
    added to a shopping cart. This feature can be used to share information about 
    excess chemicals with people in other work areas. This can help encourage 
    efficient use of chemicals. </p>
  <p><img src="chem4.jpg" width="757" height="348"></p>
  <p>Similarly, more information regarding the item can be obtained by right clicking 
    on the Component Description. You can view the MSDS of a particular component 
    by right clicking on the component as shown below. The MSDS will open in an 
    Internet browser, either Netscape or Internet Explorer. Note that the Adobe 
    Acrobat viewer must be installed for viewing PDF files. It can be downloaded 
    at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="chem5.jpg" width="957" height="306"></p>
  <h4><a name="itemcat"></a>Item Catalog</h4>
  <p>If a chemical is not found in the Part Catalog, the Item Catalog can be searched 
    by selecting &quot;<b>Item Catalog</b>&quot; from the &quot;<b>Catalog Type</b>&quot; 
    drop down box. The Item Catalog represents all chemicals that have ever been 
    defined within tcmIS. This includes items that are currently ordered for other 
    clients. The Item Number, Component Description, Packaging, Grade, Manufacturer, 
    Manufacturer Part Number, and Shelf Life are displayed for each item in the 
    Item Catalog. No client specific information is displayed.</p>
  <p><img src="chem6.jpg" width="765" height="568"> </p>
  <p>Searches of the Item Catalog can be performed in a similar manner to searches 
    of the Part Catalog. Item Catalog searches can be limited by checking the 
    check box labeled &quot;<b>Only Previous Eval Orders for:</b>&quot;. This 
    limits the search to only those items that have been previously ordered as 
    <a href="#eval">Engineering Evals</a>. An Item Catalog search for Engineering 
    Evals can be further limited by facility, work area, or requestor by selecting 
    the corresponding check boxes. </p>
  <p>Item Catalog searches will be covered in more detail in the <a href="#catadd">Adding 
    to the Catalog</a> section in this document.</p>
  <h3><a name="order"></a>Placing a Chemical or Gas Order</h3>
  <p>The next step in ordering a chemical is to add it to the shopping cart. After 
    locating a chemical in the catalog, select it by double clicking on the line 
    in the part detail area, or clicking once and then clicking the &quot;<b>Add</b>&quot; 
    button in the shopping cart. Searching and adding chemicals to the shopping 
    cart can be repeated until all needed chemicals are in the shopping cart. 
    Once a request has been added to the shopping cart, all further additions 
    to that cart must be for delivery to the same facility.</p>
  <p><img src="chem7.jpg" width="747" height="206"></p>
  <p>If a material with a comment attached to it is added to the shopping cart, 
    the comment will be displayed. After viewing the comment, clicking &quot;<b>Continue</b>&quot; 
    will add the part to the shopping cart. Clicking &quot;<b>Cancel</b>&quot; 
    will continue without adding the part to the shopping cart.</p>
  <p>After adding chemicals to the shopping cart, the quantity can be changed 
    by double clicking on the current Part Quantity and entering the quantity 
    needed. The quantity can also be changed on the Material Request Screen which 
    is described in depth below.</p>
  <p> An item can be removed from the shopping cart by clicking on the corresponding 
    line and clicking the &quot;<b>Delete Line</b>&quot; button.</p>
  <p>Once all needed chemicals have been added to the shopping cart, the next 
    step in completing the order is to &quot;<b>Check Out</b>&quot;. When the 
    order is ready to submit, clicking on the &quot;<b>Check Out</b>&quot; button 
    will display the Material Request Screen shown below. </p>
  <p><img src="chem8.jpg" width="756" height="567"></p>
  <p>The Material Request Screen allows the chemical requestor to assign the Delivery 
    Point, Need by Date, Scheduled Delivery Dates, and Charge Numbers. This must 
    be done for each line item on the request. The quantity ordered may also be 
    adjusted on this screen. </p>
  <p>The requestor may enter the <b>End User Name</b> and <b>Department</b> in 
    the corresponding text boxes to indicate the point-of-use for the Material 
    Request. This information applies to all line items on the request. The information 
    from the End User and Department lines will appear on the delivery notice. 
    These fields are flexible, and remarks can be customized to assist the end 
    user once the item is delivered. </p>
  <p>The requestor may also complete the Notes and Crit. columns. The Notes column 
    provides a dialog box for entering information. Clicking on the Crit. column 
    tells the Haas TCM buyer that this is a Priority 1 buy. A Priority 1 buy is 
    an order in which a late delivery will shut down production or, the lead-time 
    on the item is long enough to create a problem with operations. </p>
  <p>If the requestor works for a facility that uses the Financial Approval functionality, 
    and the Material Request exceeds the amount the requestor is approved to order, 
    further approval will be needed. A list of people who can approve the order 
    can be viewed by clicking on the "<b>pending</b>" link in the header section 
    of the Material Request Screen as shown below. When the Material Request is 
    submitted, it will be routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
  <p><img src="chem9.jpg" width="447" height="296"></p>
  <h4><a name="schedule"></a>Scheduling Sales Orders (Delivery Dates)</h4>
  <p> The next step in completing the Material Request Screen is to specify the 
    date the material is needed. Note that the process of assigning a need date 
    must be completed for each line item on the Material Request screen.</p>
  <p>There are two types of need dates: those that are needed <i>'on or before'</i> 
    a specified date, and those that are needed <i>'exactly on'</i> a specified 
    date or set of dates. The latter are referred to as Scheduled Deliveries.</p>
  <p>Click on the Delivery Instructions drop down menu. If an '<i>on or before</i>' 
    date is needed, simply use the &quot;<b>Deliver By</b>&quot; selection and 
    specify the requested deliver by date. This selection will inform Haas TCM 
    to deliver the material '<i>on or before</i>' the specified date. </p>
  <p><img src="chem10.jpg" width="762" height="570"></p>
  <p>If a delivery needs to be scheduled for a <i>specific</i> date, whether it 
    is a single delivery or multiple deliveries, select the &quot;<b>Schedule</b>&quot; 
    option on the Delivery Instructions drop down menu and click the &quot;<b>View 
    Schedule</b>&quot; button. The Delivery Schedule Screen will be displayed.</p>
  <p>In the Delivery Schedule Screen, deliveries can be scheduled on a regular 
    basis or on specified dates. A calendar is provided to select the delivery 
    dates. To schedule a delivery on a specific date, click the calendar date 
    and enter the quantity to be delivered in the &quot;<b>Quantity to deliver 
    on</b>:&quot; text box and press Enter. The quantity will appear on the calendar 
    on the date it is to be delivered. </p>
  <p><img src="chem11.jpg" width="454" height="543"></p>
  <p>Continue this process for all needed delivery dates. The &quot;<b>Previous</b>&quot; 
    and &quot;<b>Next</b>&quot; buttons move between calendar months. Clicking 
    the &quot;<b>Summary</b>&quot; button displays a summary of all the scheduled 
    delivery dates. In the Delivery Schedule Summary, deliveries can be deleted 
    or added by clicking on a delivery, thus highlighting it. Click the &quot;<b>Delete</b>&quot; 
    button to delete the delivery. Click the &quot;<b>New</b>&quot; button to 
    add another delivery. Clicking the &quot;<b>Go To</b>&quot; button displays 
    the Delivery Schedule Screen. When all deliveries have been scheduled, click 
    &quot;<b>OK</b>&quot;. </p>
  <p><img src="chem14.jpg" width="505" height="383"></p>
  <p>If deliveries should be scheduled on a set frequency, select the <b>&quot;Frequency</b>&quot; 
    button.</p>
  <p><img src="chem12.jpg" width="400" height="349"></p>
  <p>In the <b>&quot;Quantity</b>&quot; box, enter the number of items to be delivered 
    for each of the scheduled deliveries. For example, if one item should be delivered 
    per month, enter the number 1 in the &quot;<b>Quantity</b>&quot; box and select 
    the &quot;<b>Monthly</b>&quot; radio button. The date of the first delivery 
    should be entered in the &quot;<b>Starting Date</b>&quot; box. If deliveries 
    need to be scheduled on a more frequent basis than monthly, the &quot;<b>Daily</b>&quot; 
    radio button should be selected. For the daily scheduling option, each day 
    represents a calendar day. If a scheduled delivery is requested on a daily 
    frequency and one of those days falls on a weekend, Haas TCM will deliver 
    the item on the Friday proceeding the weekend. </p>
  <p>If the total quantity of the order was changed in the Delivery Schedule process, 
    a dialog box will appear notifying the requestor that the scheduled quantity 
    is different than the ordered quantity. Clicking &quot;<b>Yes</b>&quot; updates 
    the quantity in the original order. Clicking &quot;<b>No</b>&quot; brings 
    up the scheduling screen so the requestor can adjust the schedule. </p>
  <p><img src="chem13.jpg" width="318" height="259"></p>
  <h4><a name="charge"></a>Assigning Charge Numbers</h4>
  <p>The next step in completing a Material Request is to assign charge numbers 
    to each line item. The format of the charge number information varies depending 
    on the customer and facility. Some facilities have multiple accounting systems, 
    and the requestor will be prompted to specify which accounting system to use 
    immediately after clicking the &quot;<b>Check Out</b>&quot; button. If there 
    are multiple accounting systems, one must be selected from the drop down box 
    labeled &quot;<b>Select an Account System</b>&quot;. The selected accounting 
    system must be used for all items in the shopping cart.</p>
  <p><img src="acntsys.jpg" width="349" height="125"></p>
  <p>Some accounting systems include both direct and indirect charges. For those 
    accounting systems, for each line item, select the &quot;<b>Direct</b>&quot; 
    or &quot;<b>Indirect</b>&quot; radio button and enter the appropriate information. 
    For the &quot;<b>%</b>&quot; column, enter the percentage of the line item 
    to be charged to that number. The percentages for each line item must total 
    100%.</p>
  <p><img src="chem15.jpg" width="759" height="563"></p>
  <p>Some facilities have predefined sets charge numbers that are displayed. Select 
    the appropriate charge number for each line item and specify the percentage 
    of that line to be charged. The percentages for each line item must total 
    100%</p>
  <p><img src="chem29.jpg" width="767" height="571"></p>
  <h4><a name="submit"></a>Submitting an Order</h4>
  <p>The final step in placing a chemical or gas order is to Submit the order. 
    Before submitting the order, the requestor should review the order for accuracy 
    and completeness. If the requestor does not have all of the required information, 
    clicking the &quot;<b>Save</b>&quot; button will save the Material Request 
    at draft status. Draft orders can be retrieved and completed through the <a href="#draft">Order 
    Tracking Screen</a>. Individual lines can also be removed from a Material 
    Request by clicking the &quot;<b>Delete</b> <b>Line</b>&quot; button. The 
    entire Material Request can be deleted by clicking the &quot;<b>Delete</b>&quot; 
    button. If more parts need to be added to the order, the &quot;<b>Return to 
    Cart</b>&quot; button can be used to return to the Chemical Catalog.</p>
  <p>Check the &quot;<b>Scrap/Obsolete</b>&quot; button if this order should be 
    filled from material in inventory that has been declared scrap or obsolete.</p>
  <p>Click the &quot;<b>Submit</b>&quot; button to complete the process of placing 
    an order. If the order is for a part that is an OOR whose item is currently 
    in stock, tcmIS will prompt the requestor to allow the OOR shelf life requirement 
    to we waived to allow the stocked item to be shipped immediately. The requestor 
    is informed of the minimum remaining shelf life for the delivered items from 
    stock. Often this material is currently owned by the requestor's company and 
    may be a lost value of no one accepts the material. If this transaction is 
    authorized, tcmIS will attempt to fill the request immediately. There are 
    some occasions where shipping an OOR from stock could threaten the ability 
    to ship the stocked item to the Min/Max requirement. In these cases, the order 
    will revert to normal OOR processing. </p>
  <h3><a name="tracking"></a>Tracking a Chemical or Gas Order</h3>
  <p> The Order Tracking portion of tcmIS allows chemical requestors to determine 
    the status of an order. To access the Order Tracking Screen from elsewhere 
    within tcmIS, select the<b> </b>&quot;<b>Orders</b>&quot; button from the 
    Tool Bar as shown below.</p>
  <p><img src="menu7.jpg" width="580" height="97"> </p>
  <p>The Order Tracking Screen can also be accessed by selecting &quot;<b>Chemical 
    Order Tracking </b>&quot; from the Application Menu as shown below.</p>
  <p><img src="menu8.jpg" width="166" height="423"></p>
  <p>The Order Tracking Screen allows chemical requestors to search for requested 
    materials and view their status. This screen also allows Approvers and Releasers 
    to find the Material Requests that are in their queues waiting for attention. 
    Searches can be performed for all facilities and all work areas or for only 
    the facility and work area specified in the corresponding drop down boxes. 
    Search for requests by clicking the &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; button at the 
    bottom of the screen. </p>
  <p><img src="chem16.jpg" width="767" height="571"></p>
  <h4><a name="limit"></a>Limiting the Search</h4>
  <p>Order Tracking searches can be limited in many ways. For instance, checking 
    the &quot;<b>Orders needing my Approval</b>&quot; check box limits the search 
    to only those orders needing the current user's approval. Checking the &quot;<b>Critical 
    Only</b>&quot; check box limits the search to only those orders that were 
    marked critical when submitted.</p>
  <p>The Requestor line limits search to chemicals requested by a specific individual.

  <p><img src="chem28.jpg" width="716" height="376"></p>
  <h3><a name="catadd"></a>Adding to the Catalog</h3>
  <p>If a chemical does not exist in the catalog or it is not approved for use 
    in the specified work area, the Catalog Add options must be used to add the 
    item or get approval to use the material. To begin this process click on the 
    Catalog Add tab next to the shopping cart on the Chemical Catalog Screen. 
    Four buttons appear in the Catalog Add area to facilitate the request.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd1.jpg" width="762" height="568"></p>
  <p>The first step in adding a new chemical is to search for it in the Part Catalog. 
    The desired material may already be in the catalog, but not approved for the 
    specified facility and work area. Select the &quot;<b>Active for selected 
    Facility/Work Area</b>&quot; radio button. Uncheck the &quot;<b>Approved Only</b>&quot; 
    check box. Enter a description of the part in the Search box and click the 
    &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; button. </p>
  <p><img src="catadd2.jpg" width="768" height="571"></p>
  <p>If the desired part is found in the Part Catalog, but it is not approved 
    for the specified facility and work area, select the part by clicking on it. 
    Then, click on the button labeled "<b>New Work Area Approval</b>". </p>
  <p>If the manufactured item is found in the Part Catalog, but it is defined 
    under a part number with different specifications then those required for 
    the specified work area, select the part and click on the button labeled "<b>New 
    Catalog Part</b>". </p>
  <p><img src="catadd3.jpg" width="765" height="572"></p>
  <p>If the desired material is still not found in any of the searches above, 
    search the Item Catalog by selecting &quot;<b>Item Catalog</b>&quot; from 
    the &quot;<b>Catalog Type</b>&quot; drop down box. </p>
  <p><img src="catadd4.jpg" width="766" height="570"></p>
  <p>If the manufactured item is found in the Item Catalog, but in a different 
    size than required, select the item and click on the "<b>New Size/Packaging</b>" 
    button. </p>
  <p>If the manufactured item is found in the Item Catalog in the desired size 
    and packaging, select the item and click on the button labeled "<b>New Catalog 
    Part</b>". </p>
  <p>Finally, if there is no part defined in the Part Catalog or Item Catalog 
    that is similar to the desired material, return to the part catalog and click 
    on the button labeled "<b>New Material</b>". </p>
  <p>By selecting the appropriate starting point, tcmIS will advance to the Catalog 
    Add Request Form, inheriting as much known information as possible regarding 
    the request. For example, the screen below shows the initial section of the 
    new catalog add form with information inherited from the "<b>New Catalog Part"</b> 
    selection. Fields marked with asterisks must be completed in order to submit 
    the catalog add request.</p>
  <p> Section One of this three section form contains information about the manufactured 
    item. Section 1 is divided into three parts: New Material Information, New 
    Size / Packing Information, and Suggested Supplier Information.</p>
  <p>The New Material Information includes basic information about the Manufacturer, 
    Material Description, Grade, Manufacturer's Trade Name, and MSDS. The <img src="glass.jpg" width="36" height="18"> 
    button can be used to look up Manufacturers by Manufacturer ID or Name. The 
    Material Description will appear in the catalog as the Part Description, so 
    it should be a clear and easily understandable description of the product. 
    The Manufacturer's Trade Name should be taken directly from the MSDS. If there 
    is not already an MSDS on file for the part or there is a newer revision of 
    the MSDS than Haas TCM currently has on file, a copy of the new MSDS must 
    be sent to Haas TCM. The MSDS on file can be viewed by clicking the &quot;<b>MSDS</b>&quot; 
    button. </p>
  <p>The New Size / Packing Information includes the Manufacturer's Part Number, 
    the # per part, Size, Unit, and Package Style. Depending on what Unit is chosen, 
    the Dimension and Net Weight may also be needed. Check the &quot;<b>Sample 
    Sizing</b>&quot;<b> </b>check box if the new part is in a sample size.</p>
  <p>The Suggested Supplier information should be completed if there is a specific 
    supplier that should be used. This information includes Supplier Name, Contact 
    Name, e-mail, phone, and fax.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd5.jpg" width="767" height="568"></p>
  <p>Some materials come in kits and have multiple parts. Additional parts can 
    be added to the request by right clicking on the tab labeled &quot;<b>Part 
    1</b>&quot; then selecting &quot;<b>Add a new Part</b>&quot;. A part can be 
    deleted from a request by selecting &quot;<b>Delete Part</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd8.jpg" width="763" height="567"></p>
  <p>Once all required information is completed in Section 1, advance to the next 
    section by clicking the &quot;<b>Section 2 of 3</b>&quot; button. Information 
    in Section 1 will automatically be saved.</p>
  <p>Section 2 contains information about the item pertaining to the facility, 
    such as the internal part number and quality requirements. </p>
  <p>The catalog that the material should be added to should be specified in the 
    &quot;<b>Catalog</b>&quot; drop down list. The User Part Number and Part Description 
    may be entered in this section. If this part replaces an old part, the old 
    part number can be entered in the text box labeled &quot;<b>Replaces Part 
    Number</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p>The Order Type must be specified by selecting either the &quot;<b>OOR</b>&quot; 
    or &quot;<b>MinMax</b>&quot; radio button. OOR stands for Order on Request. 
    These are materials that are used infrequently and are not maintained in inventory. 
    OORs must be ordered each time the material is needed. MM stands for Min/Max. 
    MM orders are materials used routinely and maintained in inventory by tcmIS. 
    The estimated Quarterly Usage rate must also be completed.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd6.jpg" width="765" height="568"></p>
  <p>The required shelf life and storage temperature of the material must also 
    be specified. If the shelf life and storage temperature recommended by the 
    manufacturer is acceptable, select the radio button labeled &quot;<b>Manufacturer's 
    Recommendation</b>&quot;. If a custom shelf life and storage temperature need 
    to be specified, select the &quot;<b>User Override</b>&quot; radio button. 
    Select either &quot;<b>Indefinite</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>days</b>&quot; from 
    the &quot;<b>Shelf life</b>&quot; drop down list. Select a storage temperature 
    from the &quot;<b>at Storage temp</b>&quot; drop down list.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd9.jpg" width="764" height="570"></p>
  <p>Choosing &quot;<b>days</b>&quot; from the &quot;<b>Shelf life</b>&quot; drop 
    down list displays a text box for entering the number of days. Select either 
    the &quot;<b>Date of Receipt</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>Date of Mfg.</b>&quot; 
    radio button to specify when the shelf life of the material begins.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd10.jpg" width="764" height="568"></p>
  <p>Quality and Packaging Flowdowns can be added to the material by clicking 
    the &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; button in the Flowdown area. The Flow Down Search 
    Screen is displayed. To search for a flowdown, select either &quot;<b>Quality</b>&quot; 
    or &quot;<b>Packaging</b>&quot; from the &quot;<b>Type</b>&quot; drop down 
    list. Flowdowns can be searched by description or Name, depending which radio 
    button is selected. To add a flowdown to the new chemical add request, select 
    the flowdown by clicking it, the click the &quot;<b>Apply</b>&quot; button. 
    This can be repeated for as many flowdowns as desired. Click &quot;<b>OK</b>&quot; 
    when all flowdowns have been added. To delete a flowdown, select it by clicking 
    on it in the flowdown area, then click the &quot;<b>Delete</b>&quot; button.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd11.jpg" width="506" height="325"></p>
  <p>If the new material has a specification, select the radio button labeled 
    &quot;<b>Spec'ed Material</b>&quot;<b> </b>in the Specification area. Enter 
    the Spec ID, Revision number, Amendment number, and title. If there is already 
    a spec associated with this material, it can be viewed by clicking the &quot;<b>View</b>&quot; 
    button in the Specification area.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd12.jpg" width="760" height="569"></p>
  <p>Once all required information is completed in Section 2, advance to the next 
    section by clicking the &quot;<b>Section 3 of 3</b>&quot; button. Information 
    in Section 2 will automatically be saved.</p>
  <p>Finally, Section 3 describes information on the use and fate and use of the 
    item by one or more work areas at the facility. As information is entered 
    for a work area, selecting the "Add/Modify" button will store the information 
    for the work area in the &quot;<b>Summary</b>&quot; section. For each work 
    area, a description of the use of the material and process description must 
    be entered in the text box labeled &quot;<b>Use and Process description</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p>Materials may be pre-approved for specific user groups or for all users by 
    completing the Pre-approval Information. Pre-approving a material will decrease 
    the number of orders sent to an Approver. To pre-approve a material select 
    the user group from the &quot;<b>User Group</b>&quot; drop down list. Specify 
    how many units are approved for a specific time period in the text boxes labeled 
    &quot;<b>Qty __ per __ days</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p>The fate of the material can also be entered in the &quot;<b>Fate</b>&quot; 
    table. Enter a percentage for each fate description. The percentage must add 
    up to 100%. </p>
  <p>When all information has been entered for a work area, click the &quot;<b>Add/Modify</b>&quot; 
    button. This will save the information for the work area. Information for 
    a new work area can then be added.</p>
  <p><img src="catadd7.jpg" width="767" height="569"></p>
  <p>When all the fields marked with asterisks in each section have been completed, 
    click the "<b>Submit</b>" button. This will route the request to the appropriate 
    approvers. Upon final approval or rejection, an e-mail will be sent to the 
    requestor.</p>
  <p>If not all the information needed to complete the new chemical add request 
    is known, the request can be saved by clicking the &quot;<b>Draft</b>&quot; 
    button. A request saved as a draft can be retrieved from the Catalog Add Tracking 
    Screen. </p>
  <p>Requests can also be deleted by clicking the &quot;<b>Delete</b>&quot; button. 
  </p>
  <h3><a name="cataddtrack"></a>Catalog Add Tracking</h3>
  <p>The Catalog Add Tracking portion of tcmIS allows users to view the status 
    of a Catalog Add Request. This screen also allows approvers to find Catalog 
    Add Requests needing their approval. To access the Catalog Add Tracking Screen 
    from elsewhere within tcmIS, select the<b> </b>&quot;<b>Cat Add</b>&quot; 
    button from the Tool Bar as shown below.</p>
  <p><img src="menu11.jpg" width="763" height="150"></p>
  <p>The Catalog Add Tracking Screen can also be accessed by selecting &quot;<b>Catalog 
    Add Tracking</b>&quot; from the Application Menu as shown below.</p>
  <p><img src="menu12.jpg" width="167" height="443"></p>
  <p>The Catalog Add Tracking Screen functions similarly to the Order Tracking 
    Screen. Searches can be performed for all facilities and all work areas or 
    for only the facility and work area specified in the corresponding drop down 
    boxes. Search for Catalog Add Requests by clicking the &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; 
    or &quot;<b>Refresh</b>&quot; button at the bottom of the screen. </p>
  <p>Searches for Catalog Add Requests can be limited in many ways. Entering a 
    requestor name in the &quot;<b>Requestor</b>&quot; text box limits the search 
    to only those requests made by the specified requestor. Entering a name in 
    the &quot;<b>Approver</b>&quot; text box limits the search to only those requests 
    that have been or need to approved by the specified approver. Clicking the 
    <img src="glass.jpg" width="36" height="18"> button will display the Name 
    Search Screen.</p>
  <p>Text can be entered into the &quot;<b>Search Text</b>&quot; box that will 
    also limit the search. </p>
  <p>The Catalog Add Request Number can be entered in the &quot;<b>Request ID</b>&quot; 
    text box to locate a specific request.</p>
  <p>The search can also be limited to only those requests in a certain status 
    by checking one or more of the Status check boxes.</p>
  <p><img src="cataddtrack1.jpg" width="766" height="570"></p>
  <p>Once the Catalog Add Request is found, the status can be determined from 
    the Status column in the request details. The status of a Catalog Add Request 
    can be one of the following: Draft (New Material), Draft (New Size/Pkg), Draft 
    (New Part No), Draft (New Approval), Pending TCM QC, Pending Approval, Pending 
    Pricing, Pending Catalog, Ready to Order, and Rejected.</p>
  <p>The status of the Approval Process can be viewed for any request by selecting 
    the request and clicking the &quot;<b>Approval Detail</b>&quot; button. The 
    Approval Detail Screen Displays the material details along with the status 
    and date of every approval associated with the request.</p>
  <p><img src="cataddtrack2.jpg" width="539" height="472"></p>
  <p>Approvers should check the box labeled &quot;<b>Show all requests needing 
    my approval</b>&quot; to display all Catalog Add Requests awaiting their approval. 
    The request can be viewed by selecting the request line and clicking the &quot;<b>Cat 
    Add Detail</b>&quot; button at the bottom of the Catalog Add Tracking Screen. 
    To approve the request, the Approver should click the &quot;<b>Approve</b>&quot; 
    button in the Catalog Add Request Screen.</p>
  <h3><a name="evals"></a>Engineering Evals</h3>
  <p>Items not assigned to the requestor's catalog may be allowed restricted use 
    for evaluation purposes. The approval process is similar, but much shorter 
    than adding a new Catalog Part. Later, if desired, the item can be converted 
    to a Catalog Part. To begin the Engineering Eval process select &quot;Item 
    Catalog&quot; from the &quot;<b>Catalog Type</b>&quot; drop down list and 
    select the "Engineering Evaluation" tab to the right of the Catalog Add tab.</p>
  <p><img src="eval1.jpg" width="763" height="569"></p>
  <p>If the item to order for evaluation already exists in the Item Catalog, select 
    the item and click the button labeled &quot;<b>Place Evaluation Order from 
    Item Catalog</b>&quot;. If the item is not defined in the Item Catalog, click 
    the &quot;<b>Add New Item and Place Evaluation Order</b>&quot; button.</p>
  <p>When a material is added from the Engineering Evaluation tab, a fourth section 
    is added to the usual three section from Catalog Add Request Screen. This 
    section allows the Engineering Eval order to be placed directly from within 
    the Engineering Evaluation Request form. </p>
  <p>The End User and Department may be entered in the corresponding text boxes. 
    If the order is critical, check the box labeled &quot;<b>Critical</b>&quot;. 
    The charge number, deliver by date, delivery dock and work area should be 
    completed in the Charges and Delivery Info area. Any previous evaluation orders 
    will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.</p>

  <p>When all information has been completed, the engineering eval order can be 
    completed by clicking the &quot;<b>Submit</b>&quot; button. This will route 
    the request to the appropriate approvers. Upon final approval or rejection, 
    the requestor will be notified via e-mail.</p>

  <h2>Waste Management<a name=waste></a> </h2>
  <p>This section describes how tcmIS can be used for Waste Management functions 
    including on-site containerized waste transfers and waste pickups for off-site 
    disposal. </p>
  <p>Some client sites have elected additional services under the CGMP program 
    where Haas TCM employees transfer containers from the point of generation 
    to the 90-day generator storage area. It is very important for tcmIS waste 
    users to understand the difference between on-site waste transfer and waste 
    pickups for off-site disposal. In tcmIS, a Waste Transfer refers to the transfer 
    of containerized waste from the point of generation to the 90-day generator 
    storage area. A Waste Pickup refers to the shipment of containerized waste 
    from the 90-day generator storage area to the off site disposal location. 
  </p>
  <p>For those individuals that use tcmIS for ordering chemicals, the login for 
    Waste Management is identical to that for Chemical Ordering. After entering 
    a valid <font color="#000000">User Name and Password </font>on the login screen, 
    the Waste Management functions of tcmIS can be accessed. These functions include: 
    Waste Catalog, Waste Transfer Management, Waste Storage Management, and Waste 
    Shipping.</p>
  <h3>Waste Catalog<a name=wastecatalog></a></h3>
  <p>The first step in ordering a Waste Transfer or a Waste Pickup is to search 
    for the waste in the Waste Catalog. A Waste Catalog contains information on 
    all waste streams that are generated at a specific facility. To access the 
    Waste Catalog, select the &quot;<b>Waste</b>&quot; button from the Tool Bar 
    as shown below. </p>
  <p><img height=92 src="menu1.jpg" width=727></p>
  <p>The Waste Catalog can also be accessed by selecting "<b>Waste Catalog</b>" 
    from the Application Menu as shown below.</p>
  <p><img height=424 src="menu2.jpg" width=167></p>
  <p>The Waste Catalog screen allows a waste manager to view containerized waste 
    for waste transfer or pickup. Virtually any information known about the waste 
    can be entered in the Search box, such as profile number or waste name. The 
    more specific the information entered, the more the search is narrowed. If 
    no information is entered in the Search box, clicking the &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; 
    button will display all waste streams generated at the Facility specified 
    in the Facility drop-down list.</p>
  <p><img height=572 src="wastecat1.jpg" 
width=768></p>
  <p>It is possible to limit a Search to only those profiles that have been previously 
    shipped from a specific Accumulation Point. Selecting the desired Accumulation 
    Point from the &quot;<b>Accumulation Pt.</b>&quot; drop down list and checking 
    the &quot;<b>Previous Transfer Only</b>&quot; check box before clicking the 
    &quot;<b>Search</b>&quot; button will limit the search in this way. This feature 
    allows a waste manager to easily view only those waste streams that are shipped 
    from a specific accumulation point.</p>
  <p><img height=570 src="wastecat2.jpg" 
width=767></p>
  <p>Each column in the Waste Catalog presents data on the specific waste stream. 
    If the information does not fit in the column, it can be expanded by dragging 
    the line on the right of the column heading with the cursor. Clicking on any 
    of the column headers will sort the displayed information by that column. 
    More information can be obtained for a specific waste by left clicking anywhere 
    on the line so that the line is highlighted, then right clicking to display 
    a menu of additional selections. </p>
  <p><img height=569 src="wastecat3.jpg" 
width=766></p>
  <p>Current choices include Waste Profile (link to image or vendor website), 
    Disposition (waste management option, vendor, transporters, and location of 
    the waste disposition), and Properties (DOT classification, EPA codes, State 
    codes, characterization parameters, and SARA 313 compositions). Choices in 
    bold mean they are active and can be chosen.</p>
  <h3>Initiating a Waste Management Request<a name=WMRequest></a></h3>
  <p>The next step in generating a Waste Transfer or Waste Pickup is to initiate 
    a Waste Management Request. This is accomplished by selecting a waste stream 
    to manage from the Waste Catalog by double clicking on it, or clicking once 
    and then clicking the Add button in the Generate Waste Management Request 
    Area (the area in the top right quadrant of the screen). Be sure that the 
    area where the waste was generated is selected as the Accumulation Point from 
    the &quot;<b>Accumulation Pt.</b>&quot; drop down list. This process should 
    be repeated for all containers that need to be transferred or picked up. Note 
    that each line in the Waste Catalog represents a specific waste profile in 
    a specific type of container. </p>
  <p><img height=570 src="wasterequest1.jpg" 
  width=767></p>
  <p>When a profile is added to the Waste Management Request Area, the quantity 
    field for each container is set to 1 by default. If there is more than one 
    container, the Qty field needs to be adjusted to reflect the correct number 
    of containers. Change the Quantity by double clicking on the current number 
    and entering the correct number. Container IDs will be generated by tcmIS 
    for each of the containers that appear in the Waste Management Request Area.</p>
  <p>An item can be removed from the Waste Management Request Area by clicking 
    on the corresponding line , then clicking on the &quot;<b>Remove</b>&quot; 
    button. When the order is complete, click the &quot;<b>Generate Waste Management 
    Request</b>&quot; button. This summarizes the order so it can be reviewed 
    and edited before submitting the Waste Transfer Request or Waste Pickup Request.</p>
  <p>After the Waste Management Request has been generated, the Waste Management 
    Request tab is displayed. On this screen, the waste manager can assign the 
    transfer location for each line item on the request. Note that tcmIS has assigned 
    a container id to each container on each line.</p>
  <p><img height=569 src="wasterequest2.jpg" 
  width=764></p>
  <p>If the waste has already been transferred or is currently being transferred 
    to the storage area, the &quot;<b>Transferred</b>&quot; check box should be 
    checked. This will create a Waste Transfer Request that is visible from the 
    Waste Management Screen. The Waste Management Screen summarizes all the waste 
    that is currently in the storage area.</p>
  <p>If the waste currently needs to be transferred to the storage area, the &quot;<b>Transferred</b>&quot; 
    check box should remain unchecked. This will create a Waste Transfer Request 
    that is visible from the Waste Transfer Management screen. The Waste Transfer 
    Management screen summarizes all the waste that needs to be picked up and 
    transferred to the storage area.</p>
  <p>The location which the waste will be transferred to should be selected from 
    the &quot;<b>Transfer To</b>&quot; drop-down menu to indicate the storage 
    area the waste is destined for. This information applies to all line items 
    on the request. If entered, a default generating location and waste storage 
    area for the selected work area will be automatically displayed. The waste 
    manager must also enter the date that the containers on that line were sealed. 
    This will start environmental clocks to inform managers of the age of waste 
    in each of the containers.</p>
  <p>The Waste Management Request Screen requires the waste manager to allocate 
    charges numbers for all line items in the Waste Transfer Request. The need 
    to allocate charges and the method of allocation, is generally specific to 
    each client and facility. See the <a href="#charge">Assigning Charge Numbers</a> 
    section in this document for more information about charge numbers.</p>
  <p> Note the Extended LPP field in the upper part of the Waste Management Request 
    screen. This represents the estimated disposal cost of the highlighted line 
    item. The Extended LPP does not include transportation charges. </p>
  <p>To add any notes to a request, double-click on the Notes field (2nd column 
    from the right in figure above) and a notes box appears where any special 
    notes can be entered. Notes can be viewed from the Waste Order Tracking Screen.</p>
  <p>To complete a Waste Management Request, click the &quot;<b>Submit</b>&quot; 
    button. A Waste Management Request can be saved by clicking the &quot;<b>Draft</b>&quot; 
    button. It can then be returned to later through the Waste Transfer Management 
    screen. </p>
  <h3>Waste Transfer Management<a name=transfer></a></h3>
  <p>The Waste Transfer Management Screen summarizes the waste containers which 
    need to be picked up from the generation point and transferred to the storage 
    area. To access the Waste Transfer Management Screen, select the &quot;<b>Pickup</b>&quot; 
    button from the Tool Bar as shown below. </p>

    Transfer Mgt.</b>" from the Application menu as shown below.</p>
  <p><img height=424 src="menu4.jpg" width=167></p>
  <p>This screen displays the current status of all Waste Transfer Requests. The 
    transfer request date is shown in the Requested Transfer column. Once the 
    transfer is complete and the waste has been delivered to the storage area, 
    the box marked &quot;<b>Transferred</b>&quot; should be checked by the storage 
    area manager. Access to this box will only be granted to the storage area 
    operator or their designee. This indicates that waste has been moved from 
    the point of generation to the storage area. Upon clicking the button labeled 
    &quot;<b>Update Now</b>&quot;, the container will no longer appear in the 
    Waste Transfer Management Screen. It will be visible on the Waste Management 
    Screen.</p>
  <p><img height=568 src="transfer1.jpg" 
width=760></p>
  <p>It is possible to search for waste containers that were picked up from the 
    point of generation within a specified time period by checking the box labeled 
    &quot;<b>Picked up within ___ Days</b>&quot; and indicating time period in 
    the text box.</p>
  <p><img height=564 src="transfer2.jpg" 
width=760></p>
  <p>If a request was saved as a Draft, then it will be displayed in the Waste 
    Transfer Screen. No date appears in the Requested Transfer column for draft 
    requests. The requester can return to the draft request, complete, and submit 
    it, by highlighting that line by clicking on it, then clicking the &quot;<b>Waste 
    Request Detail</b>&quot; button. The same button can be used to view details 
    on any of the waste requests displayed on this screen.</p>
  <p><img height=571 src="transfer3.jpg" 
width=764></p>
  <p>The Waste Manager is allowed to change the Transfer Date by double-clicking 
    on that column and modifying the date.</p>
  <p><img src="transfer4.jpg" width="910" height="570"></p>
  <h3>Waste Management (Storage Management)<a name=storage></a></h3>
  <p>The Waste Management screen is used by the storage area manager to manage 
    waste in the storage area and prepare waste shipments for submittal to the 
    CGMP waste supplier. The waste manager can view containers in the storage 
    area and view select containers for shipment to a specific supplier. Although 
    the CGMP waste supplier may provide pre-printed labels and shipping documents, 
    various shipping forms can be generated on tcmIS, as can proper labeling. 
    To access the Waste Management Screen, select the &quot;<b>Mgmt</b>&quot; 
    button from the Tool Bar as shown below. </p>

  <p><img src="wastemgmt2.jpg" width="766" height="571"></p>
  <p>If a container has already been selected for off-site waste shipment but 
    not yet shipped, the order column displays the order number it is scheduled 
    to be shipped on. The entire Waste Order can be viewed by double clicking 
    on the order cell for that row. </p>
  <p>If no order number appears in the order column, the container is a candidate 
    for shipment. Containers highlighted in red are critical and need to be shipped 
    as soon as possible. </p>
  <h4><a name="accum"></a>Accumulation Containers</h4>
  <p>In the Waste Management Screen, an open container can be created in the storage 
    area for waste consolidation by clicking on the &quot;<b>New Container</b>&quot; 
    button. Select the desired type of accumulation container and click the &quot;<b>OK</b>&quot; 
    button. This feature can be used in many situations. For example, solvents 
    may be consolidated by pouring smaller containers into one 55-gallon drum. 
    Oily absorbents may be compacted from several small drums into one 30-gallon 
    fiber drum. Accumulation containers that are open and being used for waste 
    consolidation are highlighted yellow. </p>
  <p><img src="wastemgmt3.jpg" width="768" height="568"></p>
  <p> After creating an accumulation container, waste can be added to the open 
    drum by right clicking on the drum and selecting &quot;<b>Add Waste</b>&quot; 
    from the drop-down menu. </p>
  <p><img src="wastemgmt5.jpg" width="910" height="570"></p>
  <p>A screen is displayed in which the requestor must complete charge allocation 
    information and the enter the quantity in gallons for the waste being added 
    to the accumulation drum.</p>
  <p><img src="wastemgmt4.jpg" width="768" height="568"></p>
  <p>Adding waste can continue as long as it is the same waste stream and has 
    the same profile number as the accumulation container. </p>
  <p>Waste can also be transferred from a drum that is already on the Waste Management 
    Screen into an accumulation drum by selecting the drum to be transferred, 
    right clicking on it, and selecting &quot;<b>Empty Into</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p><img src="wastemgmt9.jpg" width="910" height="567"></p>
  <p>A screen is displayed where the waste manager should select the accumulation 
    container to empty the smaller container into by clicking on the desired container 
    and highlighting it. Also, the number of gallons being transferred should 
    be entered in the text box labeled &quot;<b>Amount</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p><img src="wastemgmt10.jpg" width="910" height="593"></p>
  <p>When the accumulation drum is full, or the drum is ready to be sealed, right 
    click on the accumulation container and select &quot;<b>Seal Container</b>&quot;.</p>

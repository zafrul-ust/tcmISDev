<h4><font face="Arial">Initiating a Waste Management Request</font></h4>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have generated your waste and you want to send it to waste management, you must generate a Waste Management Request. To do this, select the waste catalog item
you want managed from the Waste Catalog by double clicking on it, or clicking once and then clicking the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Add</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">
button in the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Generate Waste Management Request Area,</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">the area in the top right quadrant of the screen. You can
continue searching and adding to the request area until all of your containers are collected. Note that each line in the Waste Catalog represents a specific waste profile in a specific type of
container.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide40.jpg" width="479" height="359"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The wastes you selected are now in the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Request Area</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">and you're ready to check out.
First, you need to set the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Quantity</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">to the correct number of containers - <i>tcm</i>IS is going to automatically
generate container ids for each of the containers that you specify. Change the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Quantity</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">by double clicking on the
current number and entering your number. (Note: all waste quantities will be expressed as "each"; a 55-gallon drum, 30-gallon drum, and 5-gallon pail will all be ordered as one "each" and will all be
a separate line item in the catalog.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you make a mistake in ordering, remove the item by clicking on the corresponding line then clicking on the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
Remove</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button. When you're ready to process the order simply click on the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Generate Waste Management
Request</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button. This summarizes your order so you can review/edit the order before submitting the waste pickup request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>tcm</i>IS takes you from the Waste Catalog tab to the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Waste Management Request</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">
tab automatically (Figure below) where you can then assign the transfer location for each line item on the request. Note that <i>tcm</i>IS has assigned a container id to each container on each
line.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide41.jpg" width="479" height="359"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You must select from the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Transfer Location</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">drop-down</font><font face="Arial"
size="2">menu to indicate the generating location for the request and the storage area the waste is destined for; this information applies to all line items on the request. If entered, a default
generating location and waste storage area for the selected Work Area will be automatically displayed. You must also enter the date that the containers on that line were sealed - this will start
environmental clocks to inform managers of the age of waste in each of the containers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This screen also gives you the option of adding charge numbers for allocating charges for line items in the waste transfers. The need to allocate charges, and the
method of allocation, has generally been specific to each region, and <i>tcm</i>IS can accommodate the regional needs. If you make a mistake, the system will catch it and direct you to the problem.
Please note the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Extended LPP</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">field in the upper part of the Waste Management Request screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In some cases the 90-day generator storage area manager may NOT get a transfer request from the generator, but instead transfers containerized waste on a daily basis.
In such cases the 90-day generator storage area manager should still enter the waste management request to track the waste.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To add any notes to the request, double-click on the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Notes</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">field (2<sup>nd</sup>
column from the right in figure above) and a notes box appears to allow you to enter any special notes. Anyone viewing the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Waste Order
Tracking</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">screen (discussed later in this tutorial) will be able to view the notes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To execute your waste management request, click the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Submit</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button. If a request is
not submitted - e.g., the requestor did not click the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Submit</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button on the Waste Management Request screen - the
request will be held as a draft request. No date appears in the request date column for draft requests. When you submit your request, a dialog box appears that allows you one more chance to revise
the request. The box also lets you know where the request is going next. If you are not ready to submit, you may save your work and return to it later through the Waste Transfer Management
screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once your request is submitted, you can generate Waste Traveler labels for all of the containers on each line by clicking on the button</font> <font face="Arial" size=
"2" color="#ff0000">Print Label</font><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide42.jpg" width="479" height="359"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Waste Traveler Label, is shown above. This label can be printed on standard four-per page label paper and attached to the drum. A unique number is displayed on the
label to allow for container tracking if desired.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This label can also be printed from the right-mouse detail box on lines of subsequent screens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">That completes the steps for submittal of a waste management request from the catalog.</font></p>

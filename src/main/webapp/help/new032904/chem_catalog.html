<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first step in ordering a
chemical is to search for it in the Catalog. You may enter
virtually anything you know about the material, such as your Part
Number, Radian&rsquo;s Part Number, Trade Name, Manufacturer, or
Material Description. The more specific the information you enter
the more your search is narrowed. You can enter partial or all of
the specific information to perform your search. Multiple words as
a logical expression can also be used (separate words by AND, OR,
NOT; e.g., <i>acetone AND cleanroom</i>). Once you&rsquo;ve entered
the information - click on</font> <font face="Arial" size="2"

add additional constraints to your search like approved only or
active only depending on which facility and work area your are
searching.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before you can place an order you
need to select your work area. You can only place orders for
chemicals approved for your work area. The catalog is divided into
three sections, the columns in blue and white represent the part
details, the first two columns in green and white represent the
item details pertaining to the part and the rest of the columns
give component level details.</font></p>

a specific chemical by <b>left clicking</b> anywhere on the line so
the line is highlighted, then right clicking to display a menu of
additional selections.</font></p>

right click on the part section of the catalog table as shown

can view the MSDS of a particular component by right clicking on
the component as shown below.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide6.jpg" width="528" height="394"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The MSDS will open in an Internet

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you add a comment to a
particular part it is saved in the database. These comments will
show up later when you or somebody else is trying to add this part
to the shopping cart. You can use this tool to share information
about excess chemicals that you have in your work area with people
in other work areas. This can help you make efficient use of the
chemicals you already ordered.</font></p>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Welcome to <I>tcm</I>IS&trade; (Total Chemical Management Information System), the web-based chemical management information system that is the heart of the Chemical and Gas Management Program (CGMP). This section describes how you will be able to use <I>tcm</I>IS</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial">&trade;</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> for your waste management functions.</P>
<P>The different parts of this section show how containerized waste transfers and pickups will be ordered through <I>tcm</I>IS&trade;. For those individuals that have used the system for ordering chemicals, the <I>tcm</I>IS&trade; login for Waste Management is identical to that for Chemical Ordering.</P>
<P>Some client sites elected additional services under the CGMP program where Radian transfers containers from the point of generation to the <I>90-day generator storage area</I>. It is very important for <I>tcm</I>IS&trade; users to understand the terminology of on-site transfer of waste containers and pickups for off-site disposal of waste containers.</P>
<P>After entering your </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000">User Name </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>on the login screen (typically your user name will be your employee number), and your password (initially assigned by your administrator), you will be logged in. Select the Waste Catalog process from the Application drop-down menu (as shown below). <BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>A waste transfer in <I>tcm</I>IS&auml; <I>refers to the transfer of containerized waste from the point of generation to the 90-day generator storage area</I>. A waste pickup in tcmIS&auml; refers to the shipment of containerized waste from the 90-day generator storage area to the off site disposal location. The waste transfer screen is used to request a transfer from the point of generation to the 90-day storage area. It also can be a valuable tracking tool for containers transferred from the point of generation to the 90-day generator storage area.</P>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img src="Slide82.gif" width="517" height="67"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can use this button on most screens to generate a printable report based on the information on that screen. This is a convenient way of screen capture.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you press the print screen button you are provided with two choices as show.</font></p>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can generate the report in either PDF format, which you can not edit, or a CSV format, which you can open in MS-Excel and edit. You can also choose between getting
the report right away by choosing the interactive option or you can choose to pickup your report later by choosing the Batch option.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Interactive</font><font face="Arial" size="2">" option the report is displayed in a browser immediately after
you press ok. For "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Batch</font><font face="Arial" size="2">" method an email is sent to you informing about the status of your report which you can
pickup at your convenience.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mostly all the reports are kept on our servers for about two weeks. If you want to keep a permanent record of the reports you generated it is suggested to save the
report locally on your computer.</font></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>List</b> - this is the screen shown on figure containing a list of the wastes on the order;</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the List tab, the order can be viewed and edited by selecting the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Edit List</font> <font face="Arial" size=
"2">button. Once edited, the order can be sent by clicking the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Submit to Vendor</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">(</font><font face="Arial" size=

the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cancel Submitted Order</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">button.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The feature shown of edit list shown below allows shipments to be modified up to the day of the shipment so that the CGMP waste supplier can pickup the new additions to
the pickup request where possible.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide54.jpg" width="521" height="389"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A container can be added to the shipment order by clicking on that line. The added container will now be highlighted yellow, and will contain the Order shipment number.
A container can be removed from the shipment order by clicking on the line also. It will then lose it's yellow highlight and Order shipment number.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A point of caution exists in that the CGMP waste supplier may be limited either in the available capacity remaining on the truck or the compatibility requirements
related to existing containers on the truck. This feature provides the user with flexibility for waste containers to be added at the last minute, while still keeping an accurate accounting of the
waste shipment on <i>tcm</i>IS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can also add waste materials to the order so that the vendor can drop them at your location when he is there to pick up the waste. The figure below illustrates the
above</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">You can also add Lab Pack Container(s) in the same way</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the Shipment Info tab, the Waste Manger will enter information that is generally not known until vendor pickup or later. This information is required for
recordkeeping and reporting or costing.</font></p>

<p><img src="Slide56.jpg" width="523" height="390"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shipment Cost tab displays the price for each line item of the order, overall shipment charges, and the total shipment cost.</font></p>

<p>The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is used to activate and inactivate parts in work areas, set
   stocking levels, and add parts to work areas in tcmIS. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page can be
	accessed from the <strong>Supply Chain</strong> menu: choose <strong>Work Area Inventory</strong> and select the
	<strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> menu item. The <strong>Work Area Stock Mgmt</strong> page is launched
	in a new tab.</p>

<p>Select the facility where the work areas are located from the <strong>Facility</strong> list. You may

	Group</strong> list. The <strong>Work Area</strong> box will be populated with all active
	work areas for the facility or the work areas for the chosen work area group.</p>
<p>Select the specific work area(s) from the <strong>Work Area</strong> list. You may select a single
   work area, or select multiple work areas by holding down the CTRL key while clicking each	wanted work area
	in the <strong>Work Area</strong> box, or you may select <strong>All</strong> work areas.</p>
<p>Select the box labeled <strong>Show Inactive Parts</strong> to INCLUDE parts that have been inactivated. Select the check box
   in the <strong>Active</strong> column to activate an item. Unselect the check box in the <strong>Active</strong> column to
  inactivate an item. Click the <strong>Update</strong> link above the data grid to save any changes.</p>

		 boxes. (Your search may be specified by <strong>Part Number</strong> or <strong>Item ID</strong>.) See 
		 <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search functions</a> for more information.</p>

<p>There are two things that can be edited directly on the <strong>Work Area Stock Management</strong> page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a id="counttype"><strong>Count Type</strong></a> column identifies the method used for inventory replenishment for the 
		 item. Choose the	appropriate type from the drop-down list. 
		 <ul>
		 	<li><strong>Item ID</strong> indicates that the scan process only the quantity of each item
			    is entered; the individual containers are not scanned. Checking for and removal of expired material is
		 		 done by eye.</li>
		 	<li><strong>Receipt ID</strong> indicates that during the scan process each individual container will be 
		 		 scanned. This enables the scanner to record the expiration date and, in the case of expired material, 
		 		 beep loudly to notify the operator to remove the expired material.</li>
		 	<li><strong>KanBan</strong><!-- indicates that replenishment is done according to a production/use schedule that is 
		 		 statistically managed.--> <em>This is included for a future enhancement.</em></li>
		 </ul>	 
	</li>
	<li>When the box in the <strong>Active</strong> column is selected, the part is available within tcmIS. Clear the box 
		 to deactivate an item.</li>
</ul>

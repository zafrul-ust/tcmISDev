<p>The <strong>Work Area Stock Turns Report</strong> page is used to produce a usage report of material over the most recent six-month period with a calculation

   The <strong>Work Area Stock Turns Report</strong> page can be accessed by selecting <strong>Inventory</strong> from the <strong>Reports</strong>
	menu and the selecting <strong>Work Area Stock Turns Report</strong>. The <strong>Work Area Stock Turns Report</strong> page is launched

<p>There are six parameters which may be used to describe the Work Area Stock Turns report you want. Usually there is a 
	default value of <em>All</em> or you may select a specific value; for some lists there may be only a single option:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Division</strong> may be chosen from the list.</li>
   <li><strong>Facility Group</strong> may be chosen from the list.
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Facility</strong> may be chosen if a specific Facility Group has been selected, from the list.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>Work Area Group</strong> may be chosen from the list.
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Work Area</strong> may be chosen if a specific Work Area Group has been selected, from the list.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Select the <strong>Facility with Bin</strong> check box <em>to limit the report</em> to only those facilities which have 
      stocked Work Areas (or Cabinets).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have made your option choices, click the <strong>Search</strong> button to run the report.</p>

<p>The stock turns numbers are arranged in the right-most columns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>M1</strong> through <strong>M6</strong> columns display the quantity dispensed from the cabinet in each of the previous six months (from 
	    oldest to most recent).</li>
	<li>The <strong>Half-year Total</strong> is simply the sum of the previous six month totals.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Avg User per Week</strong> is the Half-year Total divided by the 26 weeks in the six months.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Turns</strong> is an annualized projection based on the <strong>SL</strong> (stocking level). For 
	    the given SL and at the average user per week, <strong>Turns</strong> is the number of times the inventory 
	    will be completely replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel File</strong> button to export the results of the report in Excel format.</p>

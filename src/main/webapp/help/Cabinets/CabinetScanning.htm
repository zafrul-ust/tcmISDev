<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><strong>TCM Sca</strong>n has been developed 
  by Haas TCM to allow tcmIS to make use of barcode technology to increase the 
  speed and accuracy of Chemical Management inventory operations. <strong>TCM 
  Scan</strong> is a proprietary software application which runs on Portable Data 
  Terminals (PDTs) equipped with bar code scanners. Chemical management technicians 
  using <strong>TCM Scan</strong> can quickly and accurately inventory chemical 
  stores while maintaining strict control over product location, lot status and 
  expiration dates. </font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma"><a name="ScanningTips"></a>Scanning Tips</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">We think of scanning as a simple matter of aim, 
  scan and decode. Decode is the process that occurs inside the scanner when the 
  scanner converts the lines and spaces back into the data that they represent. 
  Usually a few quick trial efforts are all that is required to master it quickly 
  and intuitively. However two important considerations can optimize any scanning 
  technique &#8211; angle and range. Some bar codes can become damaged and no 
  longer readable by the scanner, our PDTs have a full keypad to enable manual 
  entry when necessary. </font></p>
<p> <font size="-1" face="tahoma">Do not hold the terminal&#8217;s scan window 
  directly over the barcode. Laser light reflecting directly back into the scan 
  window from the bar code is known as specular reflection. This strong light 
  can blind the scanner and make decoding difficult. The area where specular reflection 
  occurs is known as the &#8220;dead zone&#8221;. </font><font size="-1" face="tahoma">You 
  can tilt the terminal up to 55 degrees forward or back and achieve a successful 
  decode. Practice quickly shows what tolerances to work within.</font><br>
</p>
<p><img src="CabScan2.gif" width="416" height="260"> </p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 1</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Any scanning device decodes well over a particular 
  working range. This range varies according to bar code density and scanning 
  device optics. Scanning within range brings quick and constant decodes while 
  scanning too close or too far away prevents decodes. You need to find the right 
  working range for the bar codes you are scanning. <br>
  The bar codes printed by tcmIS are fairly dense so it is best start scanning 
  at a distance of about 12&#8221; from the label. If the scanner does not beep 
  to signify a successful decode slowly move the scanner in closer. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The two dimensional bar code scanners do not 
  employ the traditional straight red laser line but instead use an aiming pattern 
  with corner border marks and a center crosshair.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="CabScan3.gif" width="278" height="186"></font> 
  <img src="CabScan4.gif" width="278" height="186"> </p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 2</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">When using the 2D scanner it is possible to have 
  more than one barcode in the scan zone. When this happens the scanner decodes 
  the symbol nearest the crosshairs.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">When the scanner successfully decodes a bar code 
  it will emit a beep and turn off the laser. You may find bar codes that no matter 
  how close or from what angle you scan the PDT just won&#8217;t beep. This is 
  sometime caused by an improperly formatted barcode or printer problems. The 
  most common barcode damage in Chemical Cabinet Management is caused by exposing 
  the barcode to strong chemicals, usually from container dripping or leakage, 
  followed by indiscriminate wiping to clean the container carrying the barcode. 
  <br>
  All of the tcmIS one dimensional bar codes are printed with a caption below 
  the symbol containing the actual data encoded in the barcode. When you come 
  across a barcode that will not decode simply use the PDT&#8217;s keypad to enter 
  the data exactly as it appears below the barcode followed by the <strong>Enter</strong> 
  key.</font><br>
  <br>
  <font size="-1" face="tahoma">The PDTs require a minimum amount of care. However, 
  keeping the terminal clean will avoid problems and prolong the terminal&#8217;s 
  life. Before doing any maintenance or cleaning, power the terminal off. To clean 
  a terminal use a clean, soft cloth dampened with a mild cleaner such as soap 
  and water. Do not use abrasive paper, cloth or abrasive/corrosive cleaners. 
  Wipe the entire terminal, except for the scanner window, with the damp cloth. 
  Clean the charging contacts, keypad and scan trigger. Wipe the scanner window 
  periodically with a lens tissue or other material suitable for cleaning optical 
  material such as eyeglasses. Do not pour, spray or spill any liquid on any part 
  of the terminal, particularly the scanner or scan element components.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Only materials identified with tcmIS item ID 
  labels can be controlled by the Cabinet Management process. When placing labels 
  on individual items it is important that you not obstruct any of the manufacturers 
  usage instructions or safety information and that the barcode not be bent vertically 
  in a diameter of less than 2&#8221;. The pictures below are examples of labels 
  where the scanner will not be able to read the barcode. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The pictures below are examples of labels where 
  the barcode can be read successfully.</font></p>
<p><img src="CabScan7.gif" width="283" height="167"> <img src="CabScan8.gif" width="288" height="167"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 4</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">For small containers, fold the label onto itself 
  just past the edge of the barcode and apply the remaining adhesive to the container. 
  <br>
  This forms a compact 2 sided label &#8220;flag&#8221;.</font><br>
  <br>
  <img src="CabScan9.gif" width="392" height="216"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 5</font></h6>
<p> <font size="-1" face="tahoma">Frozen materials can present a challenge because 
  the container surface is cold enough to prevent the labels adhesive from sticking 
  or because condensation forms before a label can be applied. For these items 
  or any item where the surface is incompatible with the labels adhesive apply 
  the label to a separate tag and attach the tag to the item.</font></p>
<p><img src="CabScan10.gif" width="295" height="416"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 6</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Proper labeling should ensure that only one component 
  of the kit has a barcode label although each component has a label The second 
  component has a label without a bar code. This is to ensure that we do not double 
  count kit components as &quot;eaches&quot;. <br>
  </font><br>
  <img src="CabScan11.gif" width="828" height="156"> </p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 7</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The entire scanning process must be carried out 
  in a specific order to yield consistent results. First the PDT is loaded with 
  the expiration and location data from tcmIS. <br>
  Next a technician uses the PDT to scan items in the cabinets. Finally the collected 
  data is sent back to tcmIS and processed.</font></p>
<h4><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><a name="LoadingScanner"></a>Loading the Scanner</font></h4>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The PDT uses the <strong>File Xfer</strong> function 
  to communicate with tcmIS via the host PC and the cradle. In order for the PDT 
  to properly perform cabinet scanning functions it must download data from tcmIS. 
  Likewise once you have completed scanning the PDT must send that data back to 
  tcmIS via the host PC. To Download to the PDT, log into the tcmIS Java application 
  for the customer where cabinets are located from the <strong>Java App </strong>page. 
  From the <strong>Application</strong> menu select <strong>Cabinet Management</strong>.<br>
  </font><br>
  <img src="CabScan12.gif" width="850" height="634"> </p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 8</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">There are two tabs on the<strong> Cabinet Management 
  </strong>page. Select the<strong> Download to Scanner</strong> tab. The download 
  page is arranged into several parts. On the left are list boxes for Facilities, 
  Work Groups and Cabinets. On the right are scan list boxes for the Facilities, 
  Work Groups and Cabinets that have been selected to scan. In the center are 
  pairs of buttons that add or remove items from the scan list boxes.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Begin by selecting the hub which services the 
  cabinets from the <strong>Hub</strong> drop-down list at the top of the page. 
  Next highlight one or more facilities where you intend to scan from the <strong>Facilities</strong> 
  list. In each list you can hold the SHIFT key to make multiple selections. Click 
  the arrow button that points to the <strong>Scan Facilities</strong> list box. 
  The facilities that you highlighted will move to the <strong>Scan Facilities</strong> 
  list box. Items are removed from each list by selecting them in the appropriate 
  scan list box and then clicking the arrow button that points to the left. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Click the<strong> Get Work Area</strong> button 
  on the left side of the page to populate the <strong>Work Area</strong> list 
  box. The <strong>Work Area</strong> list box will be populated with all of the 
  work areas located in the facilities that you have chosen. From the work areas 
  list, highlight one or more work areas where you intend to scan. </font><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Click 
  the arrow button that points to the <strong>Scan Work Areas</strong> list box. 
  The work areas that you had highlighted will move to the<strong> Scan Work Areas</strong>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Note that the PDT can only scan those Cabinets 
  that have been downloaded to the scanner. Cabinets that have been downloaded 
  to the scanner but not scanned will not be affected in any way. </font><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Download 
  all of the cabinets for any work area you intend on scanning. Most programs 
  do not have a large number of cabinets so there is no harm in downloading all 
  of the cabinets.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The instruction dialog that pops up was intended 
  for a different scanner configuration and it should be disregarded. Click the 
  <strong>Continue</strong> button.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">MCL-Link is a communications program that runs 
  on a PC to allow it to exchange data with the PDT. MCL-Link must be running 
  on the PC to continue. Double click the MCL Link icon on the PC desktop to start 
  the application. The icon is similar to the one in Figure 12.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">To begin using <strong>TCM Scan</strong> you 
  must provide a valid tcmIS user name. You may use the keypad to type in your 
  user name followed by the enter key or scan your user name from a bar code label. 
  Note that if the PDT will not accept your user ID use the LETMEIN user ID to 
  log in. When logging in as LETMEIN you will not be able to perform cabinet scans. 
  The LETMEIN user ID is to be used only to perform a tcmIS data download. Every 
  tcmIS data download includes a fresh user list. Once you have performed the 
  download try to login with your own user ID again. If you still can&#8217;t 
  log in call the tech center to verify that your user ID is valid and has the 
  necessary rights to operate the PDT. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The<strong> TCM Scan</strong> application consists 
  of five separate programs all accessed from the <strong>Main</strong> menu. 
  By touching the desired choice on the touch screen with either your clean finger 
  tip or the stylus housed in the back of the PDT.<strong> Cabinet Scan</strong> 
  is the main application which is used by Chemical Management Technicians to 
  maintain chemical stores and upload replenishment requirements to tcmIS. <strong>File 
  Xfer</strong> is a communications utility which allows the PDT to send and receive 
  data to and from tcmIS via a cradle and host PC. Utilities is a collection of 
  functions that can be used to check the status of data files on the PDT or even 
  the PDT itself, i.e., battery level, free memory. <strong>W&#8217;house Scan</strong>, 
  short for Warehouse Scan is used to capture an inventory count without verifying 
  item status or location. This feature will only be used as directed by the Technical 
  Center. <strong>Scan Test</strong> is used to test barcode labels. <strong>Logoff</strong> 
  will return the PDT to the <strong>Log In</strong> screen.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Warning &#8211; Use only your clean finger tip 
  or the plastic tipped stylus provided to make on-screen selections. It is very 
  tempting to use a pen or pencil instead of the provided stylus. Pencils have 
  very sharp points and pens have hardened steel writing points, both will permanently 
  damage the PDT&#8217;s touch-screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The <strong>Cabinet Scan</strong> application 
  was designed for easy use but there are a few items that should be noted. Each 
  data entry screen has an <strong>Exit</strong> button, use it to quickly return 
  to the <strong>Main</strong> menu. Each data entry screen contains a <strong>Status</strong> 
  window that displays the Current User, Cabinet, Bin, Count and Errors. While 
  scanning, a record is not saved until a quantity is entered and confirmed by 
  either pressing the enter key or scanning the next item. Pushing the <strong>Clear</strong> 
  button will return you to the previous screen until you reach the <strong>Main</strong> 
  menu. The <strong>Clear</strong> button cannot undo a scan that has been saved. 
  When a bin label is scanned the time is recorded, each item scanned in that 
  bin is marked with the same time. To preclude a duplicate count caused by inadvertently 
  scanning a bin and its contents twice tcmIS only considers the count marked 
  with the latest time when processing the <strong>Cabinet Sca</strong>n data.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">To begin scanning cabinets press the <strong>Cabinet 
  Scan</strong> button on the <strong>Main</strong> menu. The screen in Figure

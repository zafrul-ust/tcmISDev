<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The <strong>Inventory Count </strong>application 
  has been developed by Haas TCM to allow tcmIS to make use of bar code technology 
  to increase the speed and accuracy of Chemical Management inventory operations. 
  Hub Cycle Count is a proprietary software application which runs on Portable 
  Data Terminals (PDTs) equipped with bar code scanners. Chemical management technicians 
  using Hub Cycle Count can quickly and accurately inventory chemical stores while 
  maintaining strict control over product location, lot status and expiration 
  dates. </font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Hardware Setup</font></h5>
<p> <font size="-1" face="tahoma">Attach the power cord to the scanner cradle. 
  Plug the power cord into the nearest outlet. Depending on the particular model 
  the scanner cradle may use either USB or Serial connection to the host PC. Attach 
  the provided cable from the scanner cradle to the appropriate port on the host 
  computer. Place the scanner into the cradle. Whenever the scanner is in the 
  cradle and the cradle is plugged in the scanner&#8217;s battery will be charging. 
  Before using the scanner for the first time allow it to charge over night.</font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Software Setup</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"> The MCL Link software utilizes a hardware serial 
  number key, shown in Figure 1, to prevent software piracy. The hardware serial 
  number key maybe referred to as a &#8220;dongle&#8221;. Attach the dongle to 
  the parallel port of the host (pc connected to the cradle) computer.</font><br>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Setup Active-Sync and MCL Link software on host 
  desktop computer. This requires assistance from Technical Center. <em><strong>Do 
  not activate the MCL Link Software without assistance from the Technical Center</strong></em>. 
  Print bar coded user IDs (file required from Technical Center).</font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Bin Labeling</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Print bin labels from the <strong>Bin Labels</strong> 
  page. More information is available on this process from the <strong>Bin Labels 
  </strong>help page.</font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Material Labeling</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Only materials identified with tcmIS item ID 
  labels can be scanned in the Inventory Count process. When placing labels on 
  individual items it is important that you not obstruct any of the manufacturers 
  usage instructions or safety information and that the barcode not be bent vertically 
  in a diameter of less than 2&#8221;. The pictures below are examples of labels 
  where the scanner will not be able to read the barcode. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount2.gif" width="280" height="163"> 
  <img src="InvCount3.gif" width="288" height="163"> </font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 2</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The pictures below are examples of labels where 
  the barcode can be read successfully.</font></p>
<p><img src="InvCount4.gif" width="283" height="167"> <img src="InvCount5.gif" width="288" height="167"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 3</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Print extra labels for case quantities of materials 
  where all units within the container/box/case are of the same receipt ID. Once 
  individual units have been labeled, seal the box (tape it) and apply an extra 
  receipt Id label across the seal. Ensure quantity within box is indicated on 
  exterior of package (written or printed), as in Figure 4. The quantity must 
  reflect the item definition, i.e., the &#8216;each&#8217;. For example of a 
  case of 12 cans of spray paint, if the material is sold in case quantities, 
  the quantity would be (1). If the material is sold as individual containers, 
  the quantity would be (12). If the seal is unbroken, inventory counts will be 
  performed by scanning the receipt ID and entering the quantity on the box. If 
  the seal is broken, the box must be opened and individual units scanned.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount6.gif" width="289" height="170"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 4</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">For small containers, fold the label onto itself 
  just past the edge of the barcode and apply the remaining adhesive to the container. 
  <br>
  This forms a compact 2 sided label &#8220;flag&#8221;.</font></p>
<p><img src="InvCount8.gif" width="392" height="216"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 5</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Frozen materials can present a challenge because 
  the container surface is cold enough to prevent the labels adhesive from sticking 
  or because condensation forms before a label can be applied. For these items 
  or any item where the surface is incompatible with the labels adhesive apply 
  the label to a separate tag and attach the tag to the item.</font></p>
<p><img src="InvCount7.gif" width="295" height="416"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 6</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Proper labeling should ensure that only one component 
  of the kit has a barcode label although each component has a label The second 
  component has a label without a bar code. This is to ensure that we do not double 
  count kit components as &quot;eaches&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount9.gif" width="828" height="156"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 7</font></h6>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Material Placement</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Move all materials out of bins designated as 
  client-owned material to regular bin locations (these &#8220;Raystock&#8221; 
  bins are virtual bins such that there is no way to identify materials in these 
  client-owned bins separate from non-client-owned materials). Face containers 
  with the item label exposed for ease in scanning the barcode.</font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Scanning Operations</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Cycle count reports on tcmIS decrement inventory 
  after Pick QC. This provides that the receipt ID picked is properly decremented. 
  Scans performed after pick lists have been printed and picks completed and before 
  Pick QC, will result in incorrect scan totals in reports. For scan counts to 
  match totals in tcmIS, the following considerations for lot status assignments 
  must be made. If a unit of a given receipt ID is removed from the tcmIS bin 
  for testing (with the remaining units left in place), then scan totals will 
  not match the tcmIS inventory.<br>
  <br>
  The first step in scanning is to create a list of bins to scan using the <strong>Bins 
  to Scan </strong>page. More information is available on this process from the 
  <strong>Bins to Scan </strong>help page.</font> </p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Operating the Scanner</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The scanners have small batteries so by necessity 
  they are very efficient power savers. After only a short period of inactivity 
  they go into a power saving &#8220;sleep&#8221; mode where the display is turned 
  off but the processing state is maintained. When you first pick up the scanner 
  (if it has not been used for a few minutes) it will appear to be turned off, 
  it is actually asleep. To wake it up press any button on the keypad or the scan 
  trigger.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Start the <strong>Hub Cycle Count </strong>application 
  on the scanner. If the words &#8220;TCMIS Hub Cycle Count&#8221;, as in Figure 
  8, are displayed near the top of the screen the <strong>Hub Cycle Count</strong> 
  application is already running, proceed to the Logon section. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount10.gif" width="163" height="217"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 8</font></h6>
<p> <font size="-1" face="tahoma">If a Windows logo is displayed in the upper 
  left hand corner and an X in the upper right hand corner, as in Figure 9, tap 
  the X with the stylus to close the open Windows application. It may be necessary 
  to repeat this several times if more than one application is running. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount11.gif" width="166" height="217"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 9</font></h6>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount13.gif" width="166" height="219"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 11</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The MCL application will start which will then 
  automatically load the<strong> Hub Cycle Counting</strong> application. This 
  may take up to a minute, please wait. If the MCL logo is displayed in the top 
  left corner and <strong>Run Project</strong> is displayed in the lower right, 
  as in Figure 12, tap <strong>Run Project </strong>with the stylus to start the 
  <strong>Hub Cycle Counting </strong>application.</font></p>

<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 12</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Logon to the <strong>Hub Cycle Counting </strong>application. 
  The logon is used to identify who is performing the cycle count and where they 
  are performing it. Your logon id is structured as hub code-tcmis user id, i.e., 
  2102-123. Enter your logon using the keyboard, as shown in Figure 13, and press 
  <strong>Enter</strong>. </font><font size="-1" face="tahoma"> Contact the Technical 
  Center if you are unsure of your logon id.</font></p>

<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 14</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Click the<strong> Inventory Count</strong> button. 
  If the last cycle count was not completed, that count data will still be present 
  in the scanner. The scanner will display a warning giving you the option of 
  clearing the last count or continuing it</font>.</p>
<p><img src="InvCount17.gif" width="162" height="215"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 15</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">To start a new cycle count choose <strong>Delete</strong>, 
  to continue the last count choose <strong>Continue</strong>. If you mistakenly 
  choose to delete the records they cannot be recovered.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">At the <strong>Bin</strong> prompt, scan the 
  bin label on the bin location. The scanner uses an asterisk (*) prefix to identify 
  the entry as a bin ID. If you scan the bin label you need not be concerned with 
  the asterisk as it is encoded within the barcode but if you manually enter the 
  bin ID you must enter the asterisk manually. If no barcode label is available 
  enter an asterisk followed by the bin ID. Press the <strong>Enter</strong> key 
  to continue.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount18.gif" width="162" height="215"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 16</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">You may enter or scan a bin ID at any prompt. 
  The asterisk allows the scanner to identify the data as a bin ID and the scanner 
  to switch bins and return to the receipt prompt ready to scan receipts in the 
  new bin. At the receipt prompt, scan the item label.</font></p>
<p><img src="InvCount19.gif" width="162" height="214"></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 17</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"> Item labels vary from site to site to meet varying 
  customer requirements. Figure 18 shows a typical item label. If the item does 
  not have an item label manually enter the receipt ID.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma"><img src="InvCount20.gif" width="289" height="101"></font></p>
<h6><font face="Tahoma">Figure 18</font></h6>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The <strong>Qty</strong> prompt defaults to 1. 
  If the items are in a sealed container, for instance a case of 12 cans, enter 
  the qty within the container. Be aware of the issue unit of measure. In the 
  example above if the issue unit of measure is can then the qty is 12, but, if 
  the issue qty is case the qty is 1. Continue to scan item labels until all of 
  the items in the bin have been scanned then move on to the next bin. Remember, 
  if you enter any data via the keyboard you must press the enter key to continue. 
  When you scan data into the fields, the scanner automatically moves to the next 
  prompt. After scanning the last bar code, select either <strong>Save</strong> 
  on the screen or <strong>Enter</strong> on the key pad. Select <strong>Exit</strong> 
  and return scanner to cradle.</font></p>
<h5><font face="tahoma">Cycle Counting Tips</font></h5>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Scan all materials in a bin at the same time 
  (i.e., same day) to avoid changes in counts caused by receipts and picks in 
  the bin between scan and upload events. If this cannot be done, scan all units 
  of individual receipt IDs (i.e., do not scan only a subset of a receipt ID units). 
  The system will look to see if count on receipt ID matches expected quantity 
  and report accordingly. It is preferable to upload the scan data only after 
  all contents in target bins have been scanned (i.e., avoid uploading if one 
  or more bins are only partially scanned). The system will look to see if any 
  materials were not found (expected but not located) in the bin and report accordingly. 
  Reports for partially scanned bins will show missing materials. </font></p>

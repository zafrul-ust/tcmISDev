<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The <strong>Customer Purchasing </strong> page 
  enables purchasing to be performed by UTC. Haas TCM can continue to receive, 
  issue, and manage the inventory as usual, but UTC&#8217;s buyers issue purchase 
  orders outside of tcmIS. The inventory is owned by UTC and there is never any 
  payable generated in tcmIS. </font><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The <strong>Customer 
  Purchasing </strong>page can be launched from the <strong>Order Management </strong>menu 
  by selecting <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong>. Then select <strong>Customer 
  Purchasing</strong>. The page is launched in a new tab.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">UTC buyers can retrieve buy orders, or purchase 
  requests, from the <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> page. A buy order is 
  a request to purchase material generated by tcmIS that directs a buyer to place 
  a purchase order with a supplier. Buy orders are generated as a result of a 
  material request. Buy orders are also generated to replenish stock for MM items. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">To see all open buy orders for a facility, select 
  the inventory group from the <strong>Inventory Group</strong> drop-down box 
  and click <strong>Search</strong>. Select the check box labeled <strong>Show 
  only Open Requests</strong> to view only open buy orders.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">You may search for a specific buy order by entering 
  the UTC PO number in the <strong>Search </strong>box and clicking <strong>Search</strong>.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The Date Created, Purchase Request Number, Haas 
  Item ID, and Item Description are displayed. The requested quantity and packaging 
  are displayed as well. This information tells the UTC purchaser how much of 
  a specific material tcmIS would like them to purchase. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">Please note that there may be multiple buy orders 
  for the same item. These will be grouped together by default. Multiple buy orders 
  can be grouped and placed together on the same UTC PO.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="tahoma">The UTC purchaser should use the <strong>Customer 
  Purchasing </strong> page to record the UTC PO number and the quantity for each 
  buy order. Enter the UTC PO number in the <strong>PO</strong> field. Verify 
  that the quantity purchased is the same as the quantity in the <strong>Qty</strong> 
  field. If it is different, update the <strong>Qty</strong> field. Please note 
  that the quantity entered should be the quantity on the customer PO for that 
  buy order, not the total quantity for that item on the UTC PO. Enter the supplier's 
  promised delivery date in the <strong>Promised Date</strong> column. Click the 
  blue diamond to select the date from the calendar. Enter the supplier name in 
  the <strong>Supplier </strong> column. Check the <strong>OK</strong> box on 
  the left side of the but order line. Multiple buy orders can be updated at one 
  time. Click the <strong>Process</strong> link above the data grid to save the 
  data.</font></p>

<h2>Scheduled Deliveries: Advantages and Cautions</h2>
<p>Scheduled Deliveries are useful in many situations, but are best used for items with predictable usage or for items with long lead times and/or short shelf life. Due to the complex nature of scheduled deliveries, it is suggested that you discuss the requirement with your supervisor, site inventory planners, and your HGI contact prior to use. Please review these advantages and cautions to assist you and your management team.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Scheduled Deliveries</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide a reliable and timely stream of material to the work area.
			<ul>
				<li>HGI buyers work with manufacturers to schedule runs to meet delivery expectations.</li>
				<li>Alleviate concerns about overlooking quantity check-based reordering, especially for materials with short shelf life.</li>
				<li>Users only need to plan for the lead time of the initial shipment. HGI buyers are responsible for calculating all other lead times in order to meet the remaining schedule.</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>Insure proper allocation of material to the work area.
			<ul>
				<li>This dedicated inventory is not normally available to other work areas or and is not ever sent to other customers.</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>Insure that one-time buys of material are not incorporated into Min/Max set points (typically based on site usage patterns). This option can be used even if only one delivery is required.</li>
		<li>Reduce the amount of inventory stored at the HGI Hub under Min/Max guidelines (typically stock 90 days usage) thus reducing potential exposure to obsolete, scrap and expired product. 
			<ul>
				<li>Purchasing material as an OOR also reduces exposure risk, but it requires end users to calculate lead times into their planning for every shipment. </li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Cautions concerning Scheduled Deliveries</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Typically based on current usage; if usage levels change, the schedule needs to be updated. 
			<ul>
				<li>If the schedule is not updated, excess or shortage of material might occur.</li>
				<li>If/when a Scheduled Delivery expires, no additional material will be stocked at the HGI Hub until the requirement is renewed or extended.</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>Changes need to incorporate normal lead times for material when the change is for an upward ramp.
			<ul>
				<li>Schedules do not incorporate any "safety stock". For an increase normal OOR lead times might apply (3-6 weeks in many instances).</li>
				<li>Orders placed under normal MM inventory typically maintain 90 days of historical usage and thus a fair amount of safety stock is typically available.</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>These inventories are a commitment for future usage.  
			<ul>
				<li>Cancellation or changes to the order may be restricted when (1) confirming orders are placed with manufactures, (2) materials are in route, or (3) materials are at the HGI Hub or customer site.</li>
				<li>Any material HGI is unable to cancel or negotiate to return is the responsibility of the requestor. This can result in a significant amount of excess, dead, and scrap inventory if not managed cautiously.</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>Scheduled Deliveries are not included in Min/Max calculations for inventory stored at the Hub.</li>
		<li>Because material is allocated to the specific work area, others work areas are not authorized to draw from this stock unless specific instructions are given to the Hub.</li>
	</ul>
</div>	
<p>On the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> page repeated deliveries can be scheduled for specified dates or 
	on a regularly scheduled (recurrent) basis.</p>
<ul>
	<li>To schedule a delivery for specific dates: 
	<ul>
		<li>click in the text box in the <strong>Scheduled</strong> column. When the date selection form appears 
		    choose the needed date(s). Enter the quantity to be delivered on each date in the <strong>Current Quantity</strong> 
		    column. Click the <strong>Update</strong> link to save this delivery.</li>
	    <li>For more lines to add delivery dates, right-click on a row, select the <strong>Add row</strong> menu item, and provide
	        the needed information. Repeat the process to add as many deliveries as needed.</li>
	    <li>To remove a delivery date right-click on the delivery date line and select the <strong>Remove</strong> menu item.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>To schedule recurring deliveries (deliveries on a regularly scheduled basis):
	<ul>
		<li>On the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> window click on the <strong>Frequency</strong> link. tcmIS will 
		    provide a warning	window to alert you about the impact of changing your schedule: click the 
		    <strong>OK</strong> button if you wish to continue.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Frequency</strong> page will open in a new window.</li>
	</ul>

<ul>
   <li>...schedule recurring deliveries (continued)
	<ul>
		<li>Enter the quantity for each delivery in the <strong>Quantity</strong> text box.</li>
		<li>Indicate the frequency using a combination of the <strong>Frequency</strong> options (<strong>Monthly</strong>,
	    <strong>Weekly</strong>, or <strong>Daily</strong>) and their corresponding quantity boxes (<strong>Every</strong>
		 [fill in the blank] <strong>Months/Weeks/Business Days</strong>). For example
		 <ul>
		 	 <li>If one item should be delivered per month, enter the number 1 in the <strong>Quantity</strong> box,
			     select <strong>Monthly</strong>, and enter 1 in the box labeled <strong>Every<u> x </u>Months</strong> box.</li>
			 <li>If nine items should be delivered every 2 weeks, enter the number 9 in the <strong>Quantity</strong> box,
			     select <strong>Weekly</strong>, and enter 2 in the box labeled <strong>Every<u> x </u>Weeks</strong> box.</li>
			 <li>If five items should be delivered every 3 (business) days, enter the number 5 in the <strong>Quantity</strong>
			     box and enter 3 in the <strong>Every<u> x </u>Business Days</strong> box.</li>
		 </ul>
	    </li>
		 <li>Enter the total quantify for the entire schedule in the <strong>Total to Deliver</strong> box. (The total quantity
	    divided by the quantity per delivery will determine how many actual deliveries there will be, and therefore the
		 'lifetime' of the schedule.)</li>
	    <li>Specify the date on which the first scheduled delivery is to occur in the <strong>Starting Date</strong> box.
	     Click in the box and select the date on the <strong>Scheduled Date Selector</strong> form.</li>
	    <li>Finally, click the <strong>OK</strong> button to save the schedule for the line item.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the total quantity of the order was changed in the delivery schedule process, a dialog box will appear notifying
   you that the scheduled quantity is different than the ordered quantity. Clicking the <strong>Yes</strong> button
	updates the quantity in the original order and displays the <strong>Delivery Schedule</strong> page. Clicking the
	<strong>Cancel</strong> button redisplays the <strong>Delivery Frequency</strong> page so you can adjust the schedule.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="DeliverySched4.png" height="119" width="343" alt="Adjust quantity notice" />

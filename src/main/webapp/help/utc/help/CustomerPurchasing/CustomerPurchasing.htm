<p>The <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> page is used in the process whereby UTC manages 
	purchasing and purchase orders while HGI continues to receive, manage, and issue the inventory. 
	UTC buyers issue purchase orders and add the PO information to tcmIS. The inventory is 
	owned by UTC so there is never any payable for UTC generated in tcmIS.</p>
<p>The <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Order Management</strong> menu by 
  	selecting the <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> menu and then clicking on the <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> 
  	sub-menu item. The page is launched in a new tab.</p>

<p>The buyer makes the final decisions in creating the needed purchase orders and updates tcmIS information 
	on the <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> page, including the addition of the relevant <strong>PO</strong> number.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>Customer Purchasing</strong> page to identify items that need to be purchased; tcmIS adds items to 
	the page based on both stocking level (MM) and Material Request (OOR) information. To see <em>only</em> these records, 
	select the check box labeled <strong>Show only Open Requests</strong>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select the Inventory Group from the <strong>Inventory Group</strong> drop-down list, or use the 
			 default <em>All</em> selection.</li>
		<li>Select the check box labeled <strong>Show only Open Requests</strong> to limit the data to items for which a PO 
			 is still needed; leave it unselected to view both Open and Processed records</li>
		<li>You may search for a specific buy order or group of buy orders by entering some or all of the UTC 
			 PO number in the <strong>Search</strong> text box. See <a href="../Administration/Searches.htm">Search 
			 functions</a> for more information.</li>
		<li>The records will displayed in ascending order of the <strong>Item ID</strong> as that is presently 
			 the only option in the <strong>Search By</strong> drop-down-list.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button to display the records.</p>

<h3>Open Records</h3>
<p>To handle Open records</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enter the PO number in the <strong>PO</strong> text box.</li>
		<li>Modify the quantity, if needed to match the PO, in the <strong>Qty</strong> text box.
			<ul>
				<li><em>The quantity entered should be the quantity on the PO <strong>for that buy order</strong>,
					  not the total quantity for that item on the UTC PO.</em></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The <strong>Promised Date</strong> defaults to today; click on the blue diamond icon 
			 <img class="small" src="../../images/bluediamond.png" width="6" height="9" alt="blue diamond" /> to open a 
			 small calendar from which to choose the actual date committed by the supplier, or click the 
			 <strong>None</strong> button.</li>
		<li>Identify the supplier in the <strong>Supplier</strong> text box.</li>
		<li>Select the check box in the <strong>OK</strong> column for each record you want to update.</li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Process</strong> link at the top of the data grid to mark all checked records 
			 as completed.</li>
	</ul>	
<p>Once the buyer has updated the record it is no longer Open and becomes a <em>customer buy order</em> in tcmIS. 
	The HGI Hub anticipates the delivery; and processes and inventories the material on arrival; Items are issued 
	as needed by UTC. (See, also, the <a href="CustomerBuyOrders.htm">Customer Buy Orders</a> page.)</p>
<p>Please note that there may be multiple buy orders for the same item. These will be grouped together by default. 
	Multiple buy orders can be grouped and placed together on the same UTC PO.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel File</strong> button to export the data in Excel format.</p>

<h3>Processed Records</h3>
<p>To view details of, or update a processed record, click the <strong>PO</strong> number which is a link. tcmIS will open 
	a child window and display the record. This form will set the current user as the <strong>Entered By</strong> identification: 
	if it is not your record, choose the appropriate buyer name, or <em>Any Buyer</em>, from the <strong>Entered By</strong> 
	drop-down list and click the <strong>Search</strong> button to display the record you want.</p>
<p>If changes are needed, make them in the appropriate boxes, select the check box in the <strong>OK</strong> column, and 
click the <strong>Update</strong> link at the top of the data grid.</p>

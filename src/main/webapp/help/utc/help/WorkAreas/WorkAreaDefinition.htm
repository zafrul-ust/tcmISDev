<p>The <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page is used to view, manage, and print information about work area bins and parts
   set up in tcmIS. The <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page can be accessed from the <strong>Supply Chain</strong>
	menu. The <strong>Work Area
	Definition</strong> page is launched in a new tab.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="WorkAreaDef1.png" height="227" width="775" alt="Work Area Definition menu item" />
<div class="caption">Figure 1</div></div>

<p>Select the facility for the work area(s) from the <strong>Facility</strong> list. You may
   choose to narrow the range of work areas by selecting a specific work area group from the <strong>Work Area
	Group</strong> list.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button. The work areas will be displayed in the data grid.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="WorkAreaDef2.png" height="289" width="775" alt="Work Area Definition page" />
<div class="caption">Figure 2</div></div>

<p>Each work area has almost two dozen characteristics which can be viewed and managed on the <strong>Work Area
   Definition</strong> page. For clarity these are described in sections.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Active status</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>A work area may be active or inactive. If it is inactive it will not appear on the Work Area list on the 
					<strong>Catalog</strong> page: no orders can be placed and no parts added. On the 
					<strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page data grid the first (left-most) column is the 
				 	<strong>Active</strong> column. If the check box is selected for the line, the work area on that 
				 	line is active. If the box is cleared, the work area is inactive.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Work Area</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Every work area must have a name (and must belong to a work area group; see below). The name uniquely 
				 	identifies the work area to distinguish it from all other work areas. The work area name may be edited 
				 	directly in the text box in the <strong>Work Area</strong> column. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Drop Ship</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If the check box is selected materials are delivered to the work area directly from the manufacturer; 
					 if it is clear all deliveries will be from an HGI Hub.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Offsite</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If the check box is selected the work area is physically located away from the 
					facility itself; if it is clear the work area is physically located within the facility.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Work Area Group</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The work area group associates a work area with others with which it is operationally or organizationally 
				 	tied. The work area group is identified in the <strong>Group</strong> column. 
				 	<ul>
				 		<li>To locate or edit a work area group, click on the magnifying glass icon 
				 			 <img class="small" src="../../images/glass.gif" height="16" width="21"  alt="magnifying glass" /> 
				 			 in the <strong>Lookup</strong> column right of the <strong>Group</strong> column. The <strong>
				 			 <a href="#manageworkareagroups">Work Area Groups form</a></strong> will open in a new window.</li>
				 		<li>This form is NOT the standard Lookup Form because there is no Search function, but it may be used to choose a 
				 			 Work Area Group, add a new Work Area Group, or edit an existing Work Area Group.</li>
				 	</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Ordering Method</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Ordering method specifies the means by which inventory may be obtained for the work area. It 
				 	is indicated and edited using the list in the <strong>Ordering Method</strong> column. 
				 	There are three choices:
					<ul>
						<li><em>Manual Ordering</em> indicates the replenishment occurs when a customer places an order using the
	    					<strong><a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm">Catalog</a></strong> page.</li>
						<li><em>Stock Level Ordering</em> indicates the replenishment occurs when a
	    					<a href="../ScannerTraining/ScannerTraining.htm#WorkAreaScanning">work area scan</a> indicates that
	    					additional inventory is needed.</li>
						<li><em>Manual &amp; Stock Level</em> indicates that both manual and stock level ordering are used for
	    					obtaining needed inventory.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Pulled Within Days</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The number of days prior to expiry when material should be removed from the work area for 
			       Stock Level Ordering Work Areas. When a work area is scanned and a material&rsquo;s expiry date is within 
                the Pulled Within Days, the scanner  is instructed to remove the material.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Days Between Scan</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Enter the number of business days that should elapse between successive scans
			 (e.g., 5 days indicates a weekly scan).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>Changes made on the <strong>Work Area Definition</strong> page are not saved until the <strong>Update</strong> link
   is clicked.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create Excel</strong> button to export the data in Excel format.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="WorkAreaDef3.png" height="458" width="773" alt="Work Area Definition page leftmost fields" />
<div class="caption">Figure 3: leftmost fields</div></div>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Area</strong> <em>The Area fields are not in use by UTC.</em> Area is a somewhat formal description 
			of a work area or delivery point, corresponding to plant maps and the like, while delivery point and work area are frequently 
			colloquial names. The four columns are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Area</strong>: A physical location at the facility or department.</li>
				<li><strong>Building</strong>: A building name or number within a facility.</li>
				<li><strong>Room</strong>: A room name or number within a building.</li>
				<li><strong>Lookup</strong>: A link to a form to find an Area.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Inventory Group</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Select the Inventory Group, at the HGI Hub which should be the source 
			 of materials for delivery to the work area from the drop-down list in this column.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Account</strong>[ing] <strong>Sys</strong>[tem]
			<ul>
				<li>UTC facilities each use only one accounting system so the default here is the correct and only choice.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Dock Name</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Select the Dock Name used for the work area from the drop-down list in this column.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Dock Fixed</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If the check box is selected the dock may not be altered for the work area on an 
				   MR; if it is clear the dock may be selected from a list when the MR is created.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Delivery Point Name</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Select the Delivery Point Name used for the work area by clicking
					 on the magnifying glass icon in this column. tcmIS will open a child window to display the 
					 <strong>Manage Delivery Point</strong> page to select, edit, and/or create a delivery point record.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Delivery Point Fixed</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If the check box is selected the delivery point may not be altered for the work area when submitting 
				   an MR; if it is clear the delivery point may be assigned when the MR is created.</li>
			</ul>

<h3><a id="manageworkareagroups">Work Area Groups form</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Work Area Groups form</strong> lists all the existing work area groups to which any
   particular work area may be assigned. There are three things that can be done on this page.</p>

<h3><strong>Edit Work Area Directed Charge</strong></h3>
<p>Selecting the <strong>Edit Work Area Directed Charge</strong> context menu item for any record will open a window to display the 
	Directed Charge form. This form is used to view or edit the existing directed charge information for the
	<a href="../WorkAreas/WorkAreaStockMgmt.htm#EditCharge">work area</a> or the
	<a href="../Catalog/Catalog.htm#EditCharge">part</a>.</p>
<p>If directed charges have been entered for both a part and the work area, the part directed charge will be used
   rather than the work area directed charge.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 6</div></div>

<p>The Edit Work Area Directed Charge form allows modifications to the default charge distribution 
	associated with a work area. Enter or choose the appropriate charge numbers in the left column and 
	the percentage values that are appropriate in the right text column; click the <strong>Submit</strong> link to record 
	them in tcmIS. <em>This capability</em> is only available to those who have the appropriate responsibility and authority.</p>

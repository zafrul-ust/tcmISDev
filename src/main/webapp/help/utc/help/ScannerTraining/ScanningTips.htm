<p>We think of scanning as a simple matter of aim, scan and decode. Usually a few quick trial efforts are all 
	that is required to master it quickly and intuitively. (Decode is the process that occurs inside the 
	scanner when the scanner &rsquo;reads&rsquo; the lines and spaces and produces the data that they represent.) But there 
	is more going on than is obvious and some understanding of those things will help develop techniques to make the 
	process easier.</p> 
<p>Two important aspects of the technology can clarify how to optimize scanning techniques: angle and range.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Angle</strong>: Do not hold the terminal&rsquo;s scan window directly over the barcode. This strong light 
			 can blind the scanner and make decoding difficult.
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Laser light reflecting directly back into the scan window from the bar code is known as 
			 		 &rsquo;specular reflection&rsquo;.  The area where specular reflection occurs is known as the 
			 		 &rsquo;dead zone&rsquo;.</li>
				<li>You can tilt the terminal up to 55 degrees forward or back and achieve a successful decode. 
					 Practice quickly shows within what tolerances to work.</li>
			 </ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Range</strong>: Any scanning device decodes well over a particular working range. This 
			 range varies according to bar code density and scanning device optics. 
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Scanning within range brings quick and constant decodes while scanning too close or too 
			 		 far away prevents decodes. You need to find the right working range for the bar codes you are scanning.</li>
				<li>The bar codes printed by tcmIS are fairly dense so it is best start scanning at a distance of about 12&#8221; 
					 from the label. If the scanner does not beep to signify a successful decode slowly move the scanner in closer.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>The bar code scanners we use do not employ the traditional straight red laser line (1D Scanner) 
	but instead use an aiming pattern with corner border marks and a center crosshair (2D Scanner).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When using the 2D scanner it is possible to have more than one barcode in the scan zone. 
			 When this happens the scanner decodes the symbol nearest the crosshairs.</li>
	</ul>
<p>When the scanner successfully decodes a bar code it will emit a beep and turn off the laser.</p>

<p>You may find bar codes that the scanner simply will not read no matter how close or from what angle 
	you scan. This may be caused by an improperly formatted barcode (maybe from a printer problem), 
	improperly attached labels, or physical damage to the bar code label itself.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The scanner can only read a complete bar code: if part of the bar codes is obscured 
			 or otherwise unavailable, the reading will fail. (See below.)</li>
		<li>The most common barcode damage in Chemical Cabinet Management is caused by exposing the barcode 
			 to strong chemicals, usually from container dripping or leakage, followed by indiscriminate 
			 wiping to clean the container carrying the barcode.</li>
	</ul>	  
<p>All of the tcmIS bar codes are printed with a caption below the symbol containing the actual data encoded 
	in the barcode. When the scanner cannot read the barcode, whether due to an incorrectly printed, incorrectly attached, or 
	damaged label, simply use the scanner&rsquo;s keypad to enter the data exactly as it appears below the barcode 
	followed by the <strong>Enter</strong> key.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning</em></strong> &#8211; Use only your clean fingertip or the plastic tipped stylus provided to make 
	on-screen selections. It is very tempting to use a pen or pencil instead of the provided stylus. <em>Pencils have 
  very sharp points and pens have hardened steel writing points</em>: either may permanently damage the touch-screen.</p>

<p>Only materials identified with tcmIS item ID labels can be controlled by the scanning process.</p> 
<p>When placing labels on individual items it is important that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the label does not obstruct any of the manufacturer usage instructions or safety information;</li>
		<li>the barcode not be bent vertically in a diameter of less than 2 inches (which also means it cannot 
			 be creased so as to place the bar code on two opposing sides of the label.</li>
	</ul> 
<p>The pictures below are examples of labels where the scanner will not be able to read the barcode.</p>

<p>The pictures below are examples of labels where the barcode can be read successfully.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="ScanTip4.png" width="578" height="167" alt="Readable barcode labels" />
<div class="caption">Figure 4</div></div>

<p>For small containers, fold the label onto itself just past the edge of the barcode and apply the remaining 
	adhesive to the container. This forms a compact 2-sided label &#8220;flag&#8221;.</p>

<p>Frozen materials can present a challenge because the container surface is cold enough to prevent the label 
	adhesive from sticking or because condensation forms before a label can be applied. For these items or any 
	item where the surface is incompatible with the labels adhesive apply the label to a separate tag and attach 
	the tag to the item.</p>

<p>Proper labeling should ensure that only one component of the kit has a barcode label although each component 
	has a label. The second component has a label without a bar code. This is to ensure that we do not double 
  count kit components as &quot;eaches&quot;.</p>

<p>The scanning devices require a minimum amount of care. However, keeping the terminal clean will avoid problems 
	and prolong the terminal&#8217;s life.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before doing any maintenance or cleaning, power the terminal off.</li>
	<li>To clean a terminal use a clean, soft cloth dampened with a mild cleaner such as soap and water.
		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>Do not use abrasive paper, cloth or abrasive/corrosive cleaners.</em></strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Wipe the entire terminal, except for the scanner window, with the damp cloth. Clean the charging contacts, 
		 keypad and scan trigger.</li>
	<li>Wipe the scanner window periodically with a lens tissue or other material suitable for cleaning optical 
  		 material such as eyeglasses.
		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>Do not pour, spray or spill any liquid on any part of the terminal, particularly the scanner 
				 or scan element components.</em></strong></li>
		</ul>
  	</li>
</ul>

            <p align="JUSTIFY">D&#9;PACKING, PACKAGING, SHIPPING, AND RETURNABLE 
              CONTAINERS: Supplier shall be responsible for ensuring the proper 
              packaging of materials under this Contract. Packaging, packing, 
              and marking requirements shall comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200 
              and with Department of Transportation 49 CFR 10 and 171 18017.5. 
              Unless otherwise specified (A) all packing, packaging, and crating

            <p align="JUSTIFY">E&#9;INVOICE AND PAYMENT: Unless otherwise specified 
              in the Contract, a separate invoice will be issued for each shipment 
              of Items or Services rendered. The Supplier’s invoice will be addressed 
              to Radian’s Accounts Payable Department, P.O. Box 201088, Austin, 
              Texas 78720-1088 and all invoices must carry the following certificate: 
              A Supplier certifies that with respect to the production of the 
              Items and/or the performance of Services covered by the invoice, 
              it has fully complied with Sections 6,7,12, and 15 of the Fair Labor 
              Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and of regulations and Orders 
              of the United States Department of Labor under Section 14 of such 
              Act. The Supplier's right to payment is contingent upon Radian 's 
              approval and acceptance of Items delivered or Services rendered 
              in accordance with the terms and specifications called for by this 
              Contract, but payment of the stipulated price is not evidence of 
              Radian's final acceptance of the Items or Services called for in 
              the Contract. Early payment discount terms of this Contract (if 
              any) and payment of the invoices will be based upon the date specified 
              on this Contract for delivery of Items or Services or the actual 
              delivery date of such Items or Services, whichever is later. Unless 
              freight and other charges are itemized, any early payment discount 
              will be taken on the full amount of the invoice. If no early payment 
              discount is offered, payment of the invoices will be made within 
              forty-five (45) days after receipt and acceptance of Items or completion 
              and acceptance of Items delivered and Services rendered, or forty-five 
              (45) days after receipt of an acceptable invoice, whichever is later. 
              (Also, see Provisions 1, 2, 25, 26,27, and 28 of these Terms and 
              Conditions.) The rates set forth in Supplier's bids/quotations shall 
              be valid through the Period of Performance of the Contract and any 
              Option Term (defined in Part 1G below). In the event that actual 
              requirements are less than forecasted requirements, neither Radian 
              nor its Customer shall incur any liability of any kind for failure 
              to purchase forecasted requirements. Radian’s Customer’s determination 
              of purchase requirements will be final and conclusive.</p>

                CFR Chapter 60, as well as any Executive Orders as now or later

                against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, 
                color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Supplier will take

                </u>Radian shall have the right to require the Supplier to deliver 
                the Items or perform the Services again in conformity with the 
                requirements of the Contract, at no additional increase in total 
                Contract price. Supplier shall also be responsible for any costs 
                incurred by Radian and/or any costs incurred by a third party

                required to enable Supplier to re-perform in strict conformity 
                with the requirements of this Contract. When the Items delivered 
                or Services to be performed are of such a nature that the defect 
                cannot be corrected by re-delivery of Items or re-performance 
                of the Services, Radian shall have the right to (i) require the 
                Supplier to immediately take all necessary steps to ensure future 
                delivery of Items or performance of the Services are in conformity 
                with the requirements of the Contract; and (ii) reduce the Contract 
                price to reflect the reduced value of the Items delivered or Services 
                performed. In the event the Supplier fails promptly to deliver 
                the Items or perform the Services again or to take necessary steps 
                to insure future delivery of the Items or performance of the Services 
                in conformity with the requirements of the Contract, Radian shall 
                have the right to either (i) by contract or otherwise have the 
                Items delivered or Services performed in conformity with the Contract 
                requirements and charge to the Supplier any cost occasioned to 
                Radian that is directly related to the delivery of Items performance 
                of such Services; or (ii) terminate this Contract for default 
                as provided in the clause of this Contract entitled "Cancellation 
                - Default." Rejected Items will be returned to Supplier at Supplier’s 
                risk and expense for full refund.</p>

                as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5 and as stated in this Contract. 
                An "organizational conflict of interest" exists when the nature 
                of the work to be performed under this Contract may, without some 
                restriction on future activities, (a) result in an unfair competitive
